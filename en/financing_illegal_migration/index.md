Acknowledgments

This research project would have been impossible were it not for generous help from many people and institutions. First of all, I would like to thank the immigrant respondents whom I solicited to engage in interviews for their courage and trust. Their personal experiences offered invaluable insight for this first study on underground banks serving the immigrant Chinese community in the United States. Special thanks go to three immigrants, Mr. Chen, Mr. Zheng, and Ms. Chen, who helped locate the research participants. The Minen Church (New York City), the Minen-Philadelphia Church, the Chinese Christian Church, and the China Gospel Church (Philadelphia) kindly allowed me to join in various activities they hosted for research purposes, and generously agreed to let me use their premises for conducting surveys and interviews.

I am deeply indebted to the late Dr. John S. Goldkamp. I was fortunate to have had him serve as my advisor to see me through my Ph.D. study. He has left an indelible mark throughout the whole process of this dissertation research, ranging from major concerns like designing the research, shaping the analytic framework, and structuring the arguments, to minor details like grammar. His constructive critique and astute comments helped produce a solid dissertation. I also owed much to the insightful critique of the late Dr. Mark Haller, who offered guidance and timely advice while I was wrestling with the thorny theory issue, and to Dr. Kate Auerhahn for her reading the final draft with great care and posing many challenging questions in helping sharpen the focus of my analysis. My special thanks go to Professors Phil Harris, Kay Harris, Matt Hiller, and other faculty members and staff for the help and encouragement I received while working on the dissertation research.

I wish to acknowledge the funds provided by the late Dr. Goldkamp, the Graduate School, the College of Liberal Arts, and the Center for Humanities, Temple University, which enabled me to conduct the preliminary research in mainland China, and complete the interviews in New York City and Philadelphia. I also would like to take x

this opportunity to thank the Department of Criminal Justice for generously supporting me through all the years of my doctorate study.

It is with profound gratitude that I want to recognize the prayer support offered for this research and for me by fellow Christians from three Chinese churches over the years, which sustained me throughout those difficult days of my life. In particular, Dr. Weihua Niu, Mr. Pai Chung and Mrs. Kim Chung, whose loving kindness never failed to refresh and comfort me.

I am greatly indebted to my parents living an ocean away, who neither complained about the inconvenience caused by my lengthy academic pursuit in the United States nor lost faith in me.

Finally, I owe my immeasurable thanks to J. C., who has been the source of my strength and help, lifted me out of distress and despair in those trying times, and graciously taught me a lesson of persever-ance while faithfully accompanying me on this long, hard journey.

Introduction

Underground banks have had a long history in Asia; they existed long before Western banking systems came into existence (Cassidy, 1990; Passas, 2003). The Indian and Chinese underground banking systems are the two major archetypes (Sharma, 2006 ; Passas, 2003). The former system is called Hawala or Hundi in the Middle East, Indian subcon-tinent, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa, while the counterpart indigenous to China is widely known as Qianzhuang (pronounced

“ch’ien-chuang,” meaning “money shops”) among their Chinese clients both in the U.S. and in mainland China. They remain active in different parts of the world as informal financial systems, paralleling conventional banking institutions (Passas, 2003). Generally termed informal value transfer systems (IVTS), they are used to “transfer funds or value from place to place either without leaving a formal paper trail of the entire transaction or without going through regulated financial institutions at all,” and fund transfer happens without money movement (Passas, 2003, p. 8). Being part of an underground economy, with much of their activity going unnoticed, underground banks are primarily considered as a convenient and efficient instrument for expatriate workers to transfer remittances back to their country of origin (Jost & Sandhu, 2000). However, since September 11, 2001, underground banks in the Middle East and India have drawn public attention because of their alleged roles in financing terrorism. Another concern has been raised regarding the function of underground banking systems, as human smuggling has become a growing industry globally. Smuggling people into industrialized countries has become a conspicuous phenomenon in certain sending 1

2 Financing Illegal Migration

regions in China (primarily the eastern region of Fujian Province and the southern region of Zhejiang Province). This trend seems to continue unabated in spite of reinforced border control in the U.S.

and the countries of the European Union. In the 1990s, police in China, Japan, Australia, Great Britain, and the U.S. discovered that Chinese-run underground banks located in these countries had been routing huge sums back to China for illegal immigrants over the past years (Kakuchi, 2004; Mei & Wang, 2004; Preston, 2006). Though the operation of underground banks is legal in many countries, it is outlawed in China, India, and Pakistan, and by some jurisdictions in the United States. The systems have not been considered as an appropriate subject of criminological or social inquiry due to their highly secretive nature. Questions surrounding the mysterious Chinese underground banking systems abound when it is situated in the context of illegal immigration aided through human smuggling.

For example, are there border-spanning financial systems involved in the operation of smuggling Chinese? Do these Chinese-controlled underground banks facilitate illegal migration and human smuggling? Do Chinese underground banks represent a key mechanism in the larger social problem of illegal migration, or potentially pose a serious threat of potentially support other illegal activities like their counterpart systems in the Middle East and India? The need for an in-depth understanding of the relationship between these informal fund transfer systems (IFTs), illegal migration, and human smuggling has never been more pressing – given recent concerns arising from terrorism and illegal immigration in the United States.

Organized crime or illegal enterprises

In China underground banks have captured the attention of the government as well as of the general public since the beginning of the twentieth century. Their rather sinister image has been shaped by anecdotal evidence, police statements, and media accounts largely based on police reports. Their operation has become a public concern in China because of the belief that underground banks may be connected to a wide variety of criminal activities such as tax evasion, smuggling, capital flight, money laundering, and corruption. In the U.S., knowledge of Chinese-controlled underground banks remained obscure until quite recently. In 2005, a

Introduction 3

Chinese underground bank owner was convicted and sentenced for her role in human smuggling. She was found to have financed human trafficking in cooperation with Chinese gangs in NYC. The operations she masterminded included the “Golden Venture” incident in 1993, in which 10 people (out of 289 illegal Chinese immigrants being smuggled) drowned when their ship ran aground off Queens, NYC (Fritsch, 1993; Gladwell & Stassen-Berger, 1993).

The features of underground banks exemplified in this case, including the immigrant background of the operators, their family business nature, and the role of a criminal element in alliance with ethnic groups, immediately evoked the specter of “organized crime”

in the same way that human smuggling activities worldwide do in the eyes of scholars, governmental agencies, and the general public. In the 1960s organized crime theory prevailed in scholarly publications and at major government hearings in explaining criminal activities such as prostitution, gambling, loan-sharking, and narcotics trafficking, which were perceived to be controlled by ethnic groups like those of Italian, Jewish, or Irish descent (President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, 1967; Nelli, 1969).

The influence of this theory has gradually eroded since the 1970s, but observers still tend to fall back on the notion of organized crime whenever an alien-dominated crime like the human smuggling trade hits the headlines.

In contrast to the organized crime model, an illegal enterprise perspective proposes that illegal enterprises are involved in the provision of illegal goods and services to customers who have knowledge of their illegality. In different periods of American history, the list of illegal goods involved has included liquor, pornography, and narcotics. Illegal services have ranged from bookmaking, gambling, and prostitution, to loan-sharking (Haller, 1990, p. 207). The literature suggests that the properties of illegal enterprise are distinct from those of activities defined as organized crime (e.g. Smith, 1980; Reuter, 1986; Haller, 1990). Organized crime models perceive mafias or organized crime groups as centrally controlled, hierarchically structured establishments; they exercise monopoly over illegal markets through coercive power generated by corruption and violence. Proponents of the illegal enterprise model contend that illegal markets consist of “localized, fragmented, ephemeral, and undiversified enterprise”

(Reuter, 1986, p. 131). The wide range of illegal activites were largely

4 Financing Illegal Migration

small-scale and short-term, and were carried out by small, independent criminal enterprises. Also, violence was not frequently used for the enforcement of business agreements (Haller, 1990). With a focus on the role of Chinese-operated underground banks from the perspectives of their clients, the study provides an opportunity to examine whether these informal financial systems are more properly categorized as ethnic-specific illegal enterprises or as organized crime. Within the limitations of the data used in this research, if the findings of this study show that Chinese-controlled underground banks exhibit more of the characteristics of illegal enterprise, this may help make a preliminary case that these informal fund transfer institutions are not properly identified as organized crime, or as serving as part of organized crime.

Research on Chinese underground banks

The Chinese underground banking system has been an elusive subject for academic study. Much of what we know about Chinese underground banking derives from a small research literature on remittance transfer systems, in which Chinese-operated underground banks are known as one variant of informal remittance transfer systems whose services, unlike those of the registered or licensed formal sector, are not subject to the control or regulation of the competent authorities (Passas, 2003). So far, only three studies have been identified. A study by Cassidy (1990), a former CIA employee, was the first to provide a relatively reliable historical account of the Chinese underground banking system from the 18th century through the early twentieth century. His research notes that Chinese living in Southeastern Asia and the U.S. used underground banks to move money for facilitating the narcotics trade. However, he emphasizes that “while sometimes technically violable they are not inherently illegal”; the mechanisms they exploit “are the vestiges of a banking system of a far-flung people that antedates modern electronic banking” (Cassidy, 1990, p. 15). He cautions against a premature conclusion that the mechanisms are knowingly employed for criminal purposes before any further investigation is made.

Lambert (2000), a veteran crime investigator, examined the development of Chinese informal fund transfer systems in Southeast Asia since the 1980s in the light of the American government’s

Introduction 5

concern about the role of Chinese underground banks in narcotics money laundering. His study suggests that an underground banking network controlled by an organized Chinese crime group was active in support of heroin trafficking from the Golden Triangle to the U.S.

market. However, Passas argues that Lambert’s article contains many factual errors deriving from his quotation of “facts by repetition.”

Passas further points out that some statements made in Lambert’s study about the misuse of underground banks were “sheer speculation and based on no known cases ... ” (Passas, 2003, p. 26).

Passas’s preliminary study of underground banking systems worldwide offers a comprehensive overview of the distribution and operational characteristics of an underground banking system available to varied ethnic groups around the world (1999). His study briefly touches on the main forms and features of the Chinese IVTS

in Hong Kong and the U.S., and describes the regulatory measures taken by the governments in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China. Based on secondary data sources (including archival documents and interviews with scholars and law enforcement officials), Passas characterizes the Chinese system as primarily non- criminal in function. His study identifies the following attributes of the system: (1) The Chinese IVTS are characterized by one-way traffic, meaning that money primarily flows to China, while underground banking systems in other areas, such as hawala in India, are bi- directional; (2) Most of the funds remitted by clients (Chinese residing in the U.S.) were lawfully earned money, instead of rather than criminal proceeds being laundered; (3) Violence is generally not an attribute of the Chinese underground banking system; (4) IVTS in most cases do not have the capacity to deal with transactions involving substantial amounts of money generated by illegal enterprises; (5) No solid evidence indicates that corporations and state agencies are involved in illegal money transfer through the Chinese IVTS; (6) The prevalence of import/export invoice manipulation practices are less evident in the Chinese system than in hawala networks; (7) The illegal foreign currency transactions and remittance methods primarily violate the laws of China.

Despite disagreement on the extent of the growth of the Chinese underground banking system worldwide, two of these three studies asserted that the unregulated use of the system may not be a grave concern, because it is believed that ethnic groups resort to the system

6 Financing Illegal Migration

either for legitimate purposes or for relatively minor offenses. By the very nature of their illicit function, investigations into Chinese underground banks do not generate reliable official records or other primary documentation, so firsthand materials are seriously lacking in this area. This limitation is the principal rationale for the approach employed in this study, which explores the role of Chinese underground banks based on their clients’ accounts, the perspective of illegal Chinese immigrants.

As indicated above, the state of scholarship to date on Chinese underground banking is minimal. None of the previous studies has substantiated its findings by gathering firsthand information from Chinese clients or owners of underground banks. Previous inquires have also stopped short of examining how the Chinese underground banking systems have adapted to changes in Chinese socioeconomic conditions and globalization. Scant attention has been paid to factors underlying the re-emergence and growth of underground banks in a transitional China as it has moved from a centrally controlled to a free market economy.

Furthermore, previous research studies have not distinguished between different types of customer of underground banks, and failed to clearly delineate the disparate purposes of the people using the system – i.e. whether they are criminals, criminal syndicates, companies, legal residents, or illegal immigrants – in the context of China’s increased integration into a global economy. The result is that understanding of the dynamic process underlying the resurgence and growth of underground banks could be problematic, and any conclusion that underground banks are of little consequence in illegal activities could be oversimplified.

Chinese underground banks in U.S. bound illegal

immigration through human smuggling

Because of its secretive nature and the difficulty of access, the contemporary Chinese underground banking system has never received adequate treatment in scholarly work, either in its own right or as a secondary subject in studies of illegal migration and human smuggling. Little is known about its role in illegal migration and human smuggling due to lack of systematic data. Specifically, no inquiry has been made into why clients choose underground banks for sending

Introduction 7

remittances over other alternatives, their relationship with the owner/operator of underground banks, the nature of typical transactions in underground banks, how their clients view this informal value transfer system, and what discernable effects the remittances transferred through underground banks have on the lives of their families in China. Recent scholarship on Chinese smuggling has provided well-documented accounts of the ordeals that Fujianese illegal immigrants have lived through before and after arriving in the U.S. (Chin, 1999), as well as of criminal activities involved in organized international smuggling networks (Chin, 2003) and even of the impact of Chinese human smuggling on the American labor market (Kwong, 1997). Police investigation in China suggests that the sending regions for illegal immigration coincide with the areas that have thriving underground banks. Thus, there has been much speculation about the connections between the informal financial system and human smuggling operations. There are also suggestions that illegal Fujianese immigrants turn to underground banks in the U.S. to send remittances home (Chin, 1999).

This book is concerned with a particular type of Chinese underground bank, which serves as a remitting agent among a particular group of Chinese. The study examines Chinese underground banks located in Chinatown, New York City (NYC), and the ways in which they support various activities among the largely illegal immigrant populations they serve. The information is gleaned from their clients living in the U.S. These populations primarily involve undocumented Chinese laborers smuggled into the U.S. from Fujian Province, P.R. China (China), who represent the largest population of illegal Chinese migrants in the U.S. In addition to understanding the role of the underground banks in the lives of illegal Chinese immigrants, this study investigates the role Chinese underground banks play in illegal migration and human smuggling from the perspective of the immigrants, as Chinese human smuggling represents one of the important sources of illegal immigration in the world (see Smith, 1997).

This research investigates the role which Chinese underground banks have played in the decision-making processes of illegal Chinese immigrants, including their decision to migrate through smuggling, paying smuggling fees, repaying debt, supporting their families, and assisting in the migration of their families. In the

8 Financing Illegal Migration

absence of an appraisal of the role of Chinese underground banks, an understanding of the process of illegal Chinese immigration would be incomplete.

The investigation is organized into five broad exploratory areas.

These are represented by the main interview questions shown as follows:

Why do Fujianese illegals turn to underground banks?

The large presence of Chinese immigrant workers abroad implies the necessity of a financial intermediary in both the hosting and the sending countries, which functions as the remittance agent for immigrants and their families in China. Both in the past and in the present, local economic pressures seem to be the principal cause driving Chinese to find employment overseas (e.g. Chen, 1940; Chin, 1999; Watson, 1975). Thus, remittances were often the main source of income for the families in China (Hood, 1997, pp. 76–91; Watson, 1975, pp. 132–154). According to previous research, Chinese immigrants traditionally resorted to banking or the postal services as the means of dispatching their earnings to the home community.

People who did not trust banks or the postal service relied on their fellow workers as currency carriers (Watson, 1975, pp. 132–154). In the mid-1800s, the British Colonial government set up an emigration agency in the receiving community (e.g. Xiamen, a port city in South Fujian) to handle remittances for Chinese overseas laborers and their families (FO, cited in Cartier, 2001).

It is unclear whether contemporary illegal Fujianese immigrants have other alternatives to underground banks in dealing with their remittances.. Their relation with smugglers is another factor which should not be ignored: they might be compelled to use the services of underground banks under the coercion of smugglers, who want to see smuggling debts paid by smuggled Chinese immigrants in a reliable and prompt manner. Therefore, the first question the research seeks to answer is why Fujianese illegals choose underground banks as their money remitting agents.

Who operates Chinese underground banks in the U.S.?

Historically, remittance businesses were operated by individual emigrants or families with extensive connections overseas (Chen, 1940, p. 79; Woon, 1984, p. 87). A notable case was a Kuan lineage

Introduction 9

from Kaiping, Guangdong province, which ran a remittance business at their grocery stores and drugstores in British Columbia, Canada, and owned branches in Hong Kong (Woon, 1984, p. 68).

The branches of these remittance firms were responsible for currency exchange (from foreign currency to Chinese currency), notification, and delivery of the money to the emigrant families.

One of the aims of this study is to establish whether underground banks still function as remitting firms like their predecessors, and whether they exclusively serve illegal immigrants. Aside from individual immigrants or families who might continue the tradition of running remittance businesses, smuggling groups may also enter this lucrative market.

What mechanism has sustained the operation of

underground banks?

This research also examines the mechanism underlying the existence and development of underground banks. In particular, the research explores whether a kinship-based network or a bond of lineage assume importance for their operation. Lineage, a kinship organization, was distinctive in its function as a social institution which used to be prevalent in South China, allowing its members to draw on material and nonmaterial resources of the lineage (Baker, 1979; Freedman, 1958). The advantages of a lineage system may be more apparent when members venture into legal as well as illegal immigration and after they arrive in a foreign land. The lineage organization was observed to serve as a key intermediary to promote large-scale emigration for members of a Cantonese community, by raising passage money, processing paperwork, organizing transportation, and providing job opportunities abroad (Watson, 1975, pp. 87–102). In a similar vein, this lineage-based cultural attribute may facilitate the operation of underground banks, to be specific, in terms of pooling clients, setting norms, and settling disputes with clients.

What purposes did Chinese underground banks serve for illegal immigrants?

Past research suggests a number of possible uses of underground banks in illegal immigration. This study is interested in knowing the extent to which illegal immigrants relied on underground banks

10 Financing Illegal Migration

in handling remittances for the following purposes: paying smuggling fees, clearing debts incurred by smuggling fees, and sending remittances for supporting family members in China. That is, for each purpose, how frequently did they go to underground banks?

What proportions of the interviewees’ earnings, relative to their total income, were put aside as remittances? Interviewees were also asked about why they stopped using underground banks. These questions explore whether illegal immigrants are likely to use a substi-tute for underground banks as they gain experience in an ongoing integration process.

Have remittances sent through underground banks facilitated illegal migration through human smuggling?

The existing literature proposed that a primary use of underground banks was to send money back to support families in China. As a result, this research asked whether underground banks encouraged illegal migration through handling remittances of illegal immigrants.

Related questions that needed to be considered included how the remittances handled by underground banks had affected the social and economic lives of the illegal immigrants’ families back in China, an aspect of illegal immigration which the previous research on illegal Chinese immigration had not probed in-depth. It has been a longstanding tradition in South China that remittances are sent regularly by emigrant workers to support their families in the home communities. The interviews ask whether their families were aware that the money was earned under illegal conditions, and was channeled back home through an illegal avenue. The study investigates whether remittances were the main source of emigrant families’ income, or were considered as extra income; the purposes to which the emigrant families put remittances; and the ways the remittances affected changes in their families. The literature suggests that negative effects may surface when the bulk of remittances is invested in consumption or nonpro-ductive activities (Rogers, 1991, p. 236). If Chinese families’ expenditure of the remittances exhibits a similar pattern, the overseas financial support may offer an incentive to a new round of illegal emigration among their family members and relatives, and among other families through demonstration and relative deprivation effects.

Through searching for answers to these questions, this research fills in significant gaps in the sparse literature on the Chinese informal

Introduction 11

fund transfer system and its role in illegal immigration. As Kwong (1997) points out, illegal immigration is essentially a labor issue.

Chinese illegal immigrants risk their lives and endure hardships to seek better-paying jobs in the U.S. and improve the livelihood of their families back in China. Arguably, this objective would be frustrated if a financial intermediary did not exist to aid those illegal immigrants in moving their money safely back to China. This research considers whether Chinese underground banks play a central role in helping Chinese illegal immigrants overcome legal obstacles and achieve their goal.

Although illegal immigration is treated as the context of this study and the data are unable to address directly the link between underground banking and human smuggling, the findings in this study may have implications for illegal immigration control policy.

As some widely adopted countermeasures against illegal immigration, such as tightened border control, have become increasingly costly, findings in immigration policy studies raise questions of whether such measures will produce a detectable effect in the long run (Naylor, 2004). Current “toughened” efforts do not thwart the resolve of would-be immigrants to gain unauthorized entry; nor do they undercut the operations of international crime groups in organizing human smuggling (Naylor, 2005). Thus the role of the financial system undergirding human smuggling may be a key element in the review of such policies.

This study provides an understanding of the thoughts and views of illegal immigrants about this informal fund transfer system, which stands as a major alternative to the mainstream financial system.

Of particular interest is how their knowledge about underground banks as remitting agencies informed their decisions to come to the U.S., and how the remittances transferred through underground banks have affected their lives in the U.S. and the lives of their families left behind in China. The primary data source for this research was face-to-face surveys and interviews with 27 Fujianese illegal immigrants selected from local communities in the Greater Philadelphia area and NYC, who used to be clients of Chinese underground banks. Through interviews with clients of Chinese underground banks in the United States, the study analyzes their perspectives as a first step in examining the mostly hidden role of the illegal financial institution.

12 Financing Illegal Migration

Several theoretical perspectives on illegal and ethnic enterprise underpin the present research. As distinct from the organized crime models, the framework used in this study calls for greater attention to an understanding of the ‘task environment’ which consists of suppliers, customers, competitors, and regulators, determining the structure and operation of illegal enterprise (Smith, 1980, p. 18), and social structure shaping economic behavior (Peng, 2004; Portes & Sensenbrenner, 1993). An integration of the illegal enterprise model and ethnic network perspectives lends a powerful analytical tool for plumbing this unexplored subject. If, like legal businesses, illegal enterprises such as underground banks are amenable to the influences of the “invisible hand” of market forces and the “visible hand”

of government regulation, this study makes a contribution to the effort to explain why the illegal services provided by Chinese underground banks are attractive to a specific ethnic group of illegal immigrants, and how the viability of underground systems is sustained in the face of uncertainties and risks growing out of the illegality of the services.

Through inductive analysis based on the narrative data derived from in-depth interviews with the clients of underground banks, this research is able to trace the trajectory of the evolution of Chinese underground banks over the past decades. Within the limitation of the data, the research also explores the role of these financial intermediaries in sustaining transnational illegal labor migration achieved through human smuggling. This book contributes to a fuller understanding of current illegal immigration and human smuggling, and may inform law enforcement authorities in formulating more effective anti-human smuggling policies.

The book is structured into five chapters. By way of background, Chapter 2 offers an overview of the historical setting of Chinese underground banks in China, and analyzes how state policy and financial institutions created the conditions for the resurgence of informal financial systems, particularly in South China, in the second half of the twentieth century. The remaining part of the chapter illustrates how Chinatown, NYC, serves as an important setting for the operation of Chinese underground banks, by tracing the history of Chinese immigration in the twentieth century. The in-depth analysis of the data and the findings are discussed in detail in Chapters 3

and 4 . Chapter 5 concludes with a discussion of the implications for

Chinese Underground Banks

in China and the United States:

Background

Chinese underground banks are not a recent phenomenon. An analysis of their historical evolution indicates that they were burgeoning in China’s financial market in the first half of the 20th century and then disappeared from the scene by the 1950s. A reforming China in the later part of the 20th centu\ry furnished an opportunity to resurrect these old institutions, first in South China. Considering that these informal fund transfer systems (IFTs) are illegal in both the U.S. and China, how they thrived in China, expanded their territory into Chinatown, NYC, and became implicated in human smuggling is a mystery worthy of unraveling. Interviews with Fujianese illegal immigrants in this study show that underground banks in the U.S. collaborated with their counterparts in China in smoothly transferring the earnings of Fujianese illegal immigrant workers from the U.S. to China, since transactions undertaken through underground banks have never gone through conventional financial systems . The first section of this chapter focuses on a historical review, including the recent development of the systems in post-reform China, while the second section centers on how Chinatown has been shaped by tidal waves of immigration over time, particularly illegal immigration beginning in the late 1980s. A review of Chinatown’s history is important because my data suggest that Chinatown is a safe haven for the growth of Chinese underground banks, which exclusively serve the needs of illegal immigrants coming from Fujian Province. 1

Historical background of chinese underground banks: P’iao-hao and Qianzhuang , old-style native banks

The origin of Chinese underground banks is traceable to two indigenous financial institutions beginning in the early 18th and 19th centuries: P’iao-hao (literally “draft banks,” which were founded by merchants from Shanxi Province in North China) and qianzhuang (pronounced “ch’ien-chuang” and meaning “money shops”) (Yang, 1952). These institutions were operated with the full recognition of Chinese governments, specifically the Ch’ing, the last imperial dynasty (1644–1911), and the first Republican Government of China (1911–1949) (Cheng, 2003). Throughout the turbulent history of China, these native banks assumed their own developmental trajectories and exerted significant influence on the financial markets of China, but both of them met their demise at the beginning of the second half of the 20th century.

As one of the first types of bank in China,

p’iao-hao acquired

great influence in North China (Yang, 1952). Originally they were founded to furnish local Shanxi merchants with the safe transfer of funds through the issuing of drafts between local branches. At the end of 19th century, with the development of interregional domestic trade, they evolved into a nationwide network in major cities, where they derived profits by making loans and accepting deposits aside from remittance charges (Yang, 1952, p. 81). They also served as semi-governmental fiscal agents, rendering reliable service for the state and provincial treasuries. Before modern Western banks landed in China, Shanxi p’iao-hao had established hegemony over the interregional remittance business (Cheng, 2003).

Qianzhuang was the other major Chinese native banking system burgeoning in South China

in the 19th century. Stimulated by

commercial growth in coastal and port cities, their business was oriented toward accommodating the needs arising out of foreign and coastal trade by dealing in money exchange and issuing credit.

They were distinguished from Shanxi banks in that they were “independent, small-scale,” local banks “whose activities were coordinated by local guilds and bankers’ associations” (Jones, 1972, p. 51; Yang, 1952, pp. 84–85). Originally they clustered in the Yangtze delta area around Shanghai, but later they spread throughout South and Central China. Their clientele was wide-ranging, including both

16 Financing Illegal Migration

the elite – gentry, rich merchants, and bureaucrats – and the lower class – peasants, artisans and petty traders (Jones, 1972). Qianzhuang played a prominent role in financial and commercial transactions as brokers between foreign banks and Chinese traders, and between the city and rural areas in China (Jones, 1972, p. 75). Toward the end of the 19th century, p’iao-hao and qianzhuang together wielded significant capital power in China.

P’iao-haos began to decline with the fall of Ch’ing dynasty in 1911, and their fate was sealed by their lack of competitive strength against foreign banks and modern Chinese banks, due to their narrow focus on remittance services, and their failure to adapt to a changing politico-economic environment.

Qianzhuangs held out longer,

thanks to the close ties they had forged with local businesses and their flexible operation styles, which carried them through political and economic crises. Yet the qianzhuangs were ultimately unable to recover the lost ground in the financial market in the face of the stronger influence of modern Chinese banks, and they were eventually disrupted by the eight-year Sino-Japan war (1937–1945), followed by a four-year civil war (Cheng, 2003, p. 240). The subsequent establishment of Communist control over China in 1949 dealt the last, deadly blow in a process of nationalization of Chinese private enterprises, shattering the hope of further development of private Chinese banks in China. However, qianzhuangs reemerged and flourished in Chinese society in the late 20th century, finding themselves in great demand among ordinary people, private businesses, and criminals alike, while antagonizing a powerful government bent on stamping them out at any costs.

Re-emergence of Chinese underground banks in

mainland China: state policy and the financial

environment

The fact that new generations of Chinese underground banks flourish in the southern coastal regions instead of the traditionally affluent Yangtze delta area in East China illustrates the catalytic role of the state’s economic policies. With its determination to depart from its longstanding socialist economic course, the Chinese government took bold steps to initiate “open,” market-oriented economic reform in the late 1970s. Two coastal provinces, Guangdong and Fujian, were

Chinese Underground Banks in China and the United States 17

chosen as the testing grounds to experiment with a capitalist-style market economy. Since then, these two regions have accomplished spectacular achievements in the economic sphere, particularly in the arena of international economic involvement. The success of the regional economy in these two provinces is largely due to multiple forces working in combination, including natural advantages, local initiatives, and resources made available by overseas connections (Chu & Yeung, 2000). The economic growth in these regions set the stage for the comeback of underground banks.

Open to the world

The preferential policies granted by the central government to Guangdong and Fujian evidently had far-reaching consequences in the local economy in at least two dimensions. First, geared toward attracting foreign investment and foreign exchange earnings, the open policy set off a massive two-way population movement. As a result of the lifted ban on direct contact with foreign connections in the early 1980s, visits to China by Chinese living abroad and visitors from Western countries rose over the years (Vogel, 1989). On the other hand, as strict controls on cross-border travel were eased, many Chinese citizens were able to go abroad for private purposes for the first time. Ever year since then, a substantial number of Chinese officials, scholars, and students have made overseas trips.

The second dimension is the economic landscape. The same economic reform brought about a dramatic transformation in the economic landscape within a relatively short period in the two regions. These two provinces embarked on a development path distinguishable from other provinces in China (Long, 1994). Both successfully achieved the shift from an agriculture-oriented society to export-oriented light industry, funded by large-scale inflows of foreign direct investment, particularly from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. Rapidly expanding foreign-funded enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises (i.e. town and village enterprises) took the place of the declining state sector in the majority share of total industrial output value and the province’s export earnings (Goodman & Feng , 1994).

Given such an impressive achievement in a relatively short period of time, those who have knowledge of China’s strict foreign exchange controls would raise a question: How did those foreign-funded and

18 Financing Illegal Migration

private sector enterprises thrive when the foreign currency needed in their business operation was in serious shortage? To answer these questions, an examination of changes in China’s regulatory environment for foreign exchange and financing is necessary.

Foreign exchange controls

From 1949 to 1979 China had maintained extensive control over foreign exchange in that the circulation of foreign currencies was forbidden; the central government supervised the foreign exchange business through the Bank of China. Only a handful of designated state enterprises were allowed to engage in foreign trade (Hall, 2004).

As of 1950, all foreign exchange holdings were required by law to be sold to the Bank of China. The allocation of foreign exchange was dictated through state planning. Also, the longstanding practice of substantially overvaluing Chinese currency resulted in a severely short supply of foreign exchange (Lardy, 1992). The Chinese currency, renminbi (literally “people’s currency”), was inconvertible due to the foreign exchange controls.

In order to enhance export incentives and encourage the introduction of foreign investment, foreign exchange controls began to decentralize in the 1980s. China came a long way from the establishment of swap markets 2 to a national inter-bank foreign exchange market in 1994. By the mid-1990s almost all exchange controls on trade transactions for domestic firms had been eliminated. In December 1996, the remaining controls on foreign exchange exist for transactions of foreign-invested enterprises under current account, and thus the currency, were freely convertible in keeping with Article VIII of the International Monetary Fund Articles of Agreement. Currently, foreign exchange transactions on capital account are still under strict control but, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control (SAFE), they will achieve “basic convertibility” by 2010 ( Chan, 2004). 3 So in practice, even though the controls on current account transactions have been relaxed, foreign exchange transactions on capital account are subject to strict regulations to ensure the repatria-tion of all earnings on capital account and to prevent outflows of foreign currency through illegal remittances (Drumm, 1995).

Foreign exchange for individual purposes, such as travel or study abroad, is still strictly controlled (Chan, 2004).

Chinese Underground Banks in China and the United States 19

The restraints created by China’s foreign exchange controls have posed serious problems for foreign-funded firms and Chinese firms alike. For both types of enterprise, the national inter-bank foreign exchange market is the only official channel through which they are allowed to conduct foreign exchange transactions. But not all enterprises qualify for transactions at the swap centers or the new foreign exchange market. It remains burdensome for these firms to satisfy the strictly prescribed procedures for application and approval (Lardy, 1992). Restrictions are also placed on the individual purchase of foreign exchange. Not until 1995 were individual Chinese nationals allowed to buy foreign currency from designated banks at the swap market rate (Chan, 2004). A ceiling on purchases of foreign currency, complex procedures, and higher fees only served to turn away prospective clients.

China’s foreign exchange controls had placed limitations on the entry qualification on the demand side of the foreign exchange market since the 1980s. Enterprises in need of purchasing foreign currency had to be licensed importers registered with the local branch of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control (SAFE), and then had to obtain governmental approval for the intended use of the foreign currency. Furthermore, buyers had little freedom to trade their foreign currency surplus because the requirement for official approval dictated that foreign currency be used only for funding imports within a designated time period (Lardy, 1992). For those small or medium-size enterprises needing large sums of Chinese currency to pay employees and run daily operations, obtaining Chinese currency through formal channels was a major problem. The ceiling on foreign exchange imposed by state banks, commission fees, cumbersome procedures, and an unfavorable official foreign exchange rate created a hindrance for these enterprises to access the necessary funds, especially given that they usually requested rapid capital turnover due to their short production cycle (Lardy, 1992). It was not uncommon for them to turn to the local black market. The foreign exchange black markets became a frequent resort for an assortment of clients, including state enterprises, private companies, expatriate employees, local individuals, and tourists. It is fair to conclude that the foreign exchange controls in large part created a great incentive for illegal foreign exchange transactions on black markets. 4

20 Financing Illegal Migration

The foreign exchange rates on black market dealings varied with the demand and supply. Transactions were limited to local clients dealing in small sums. As demand for foreign exchange grew with the expansion of China’s economy, the disadvantages of the black market became more evident. First, the fluidity of transactions worked against establishing credibility. Second, clients did not have a sense of security during transactions, for they were afraid of being cheated by foreign exchange dealers, and always had to look over their shoulders to guard against police raids (Hall, 2004). Arguably, black markets based on curbside transactions were eventually unable to meet the rising demands of the increasingly sophisticated clientele, leaving considerable room for underground banks to fill the void. For those aspiring entrepreneurs active on the market, starting up an underground bank could not only help shed their status as street-level hustlers and dealers, but also provide a structure for achieving a certain degree of business scale.

Discriminatory lending policy and practices against the non-state sector

The course of economic reform in the last few decades has revealed a trend in which the growth of the private sector has been outstrip-ping that of the state sector and has played a more important role in shaping the landscape of China’s economy. Official statistics show that the private sector has been the engine driving the development of the national economy (Garnaut et al., 2001). 5 Surprisingly, the extraordinary progress in the private sector has been achieved without the financial support of state-controlled banking systems (Garnaut et al., 2001). 6 The state banking sector, which is dominated by four large but inefficient state banks, 7 adheres to a long-standing state policy that biases lending decisions against the private sector and in favor of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) out of ideological ster-eotype (i.e. socialist enterprises vs. capitalist enterprises) and political concerns. The large portion of loans has been used to finance loss-making SOEs for fear of social unrest caused by bankruptcy and massive unemployment (Allen et al., 2005; Tsai, 2002).

Another reason for excluding the private sector from official financing is the presence of so-called policy, lending prevalent at the provincial and local levels. 8 The interference of provincial and local governments in policy-dictated lending decisions usually channels

Chinese Underground Banks in China and the United States 21

loans into their favorite projects, which are those that are considered strategically important for local development (Garnaut et al., 2001; Tsai, 2002). The lack within state banks of well-trained staff knowledgeable about risk assessment and management also adds to the difficulties for private businesses in accessing formal sources of financing, since China’s banking institutions generally do not operate on a commercial basis but are instead influenced by political criteria (Tsai, 2002). Additional impediments for private firms to obtaining bank loans include collateral requirements, restrictive policies set by the central bank on interest rate management, and complex application procedures (Garnaut et al., 2001).

In the face of these institutional constraints, the easy accessibility, flexibility, versatility, and efficiency of the lending offered by informal financial mechanisms like underground banking systems have great appeal to private firms, higher interest rates notwithstanding (Garnaut et al., 2001; Tsai, 2006 ). 9 A 1999 study based on 628 questionnaires completed by private firms in China pointed to 49 percent of the sample turning to the informal market for financing (Garnaut et al., 2001). According to a government-sponsored study, lending through underground banks already accounted for more than 28 percent of the share of credit markets, or about 800 billion yuan a year (Kwok, 2012). While a substantially large part of the lending was invested in securities and futures markets (Kwok, 2006), one-third of it went to small and medium-sized businesses, and 55 percent of the loans go to farmers (“Worried about illicit lending,” 2007). China’s private businesses would have long since perished had it not been for informal financial institutions pumping capital into those fund-starving private enterprises. Research also found

that informal

but largely illegal financing practices have a burgeoning market and are quite institutionalized in southern coastal regions such as the Delta area of Guangdong Province, the Greater Fuzhou area of Fujian Province, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, where a rapidly developing local private sector generates a demand for credit which outpaces official supply. However, their financing faces structural constraints because of state banks’ unwillingness or incapacity to meet their needs (Tsai, 2002, 2006). The last two regions, Fuzhou and Wenzhou, later became the major sources of illegal migration through human smuggling since 1990s.

Regional variance in growth of underground banks in Fujian

Since the onset of economic reform, China has vigorously pursued growth-oriented development strategies favoring coastal regions, which bring forth a distinct regional development model. The eastern, southeast and south coastal regions between Shanghai and Guangzhou have derived the most benefit from the strategies.

Economic growth is not evenly spread across the nation. Guangdong and Fujian, located in South China are in the forefront of economic development, and their achievement has been the most remarkable (Tsai, 2002). Against this backdrop, underground banks have staged a comeback and are found to proliferate primarily in these two provinces.

Fujian and Guangdong share commonalities in many aspects of local history and economic development. Both of the provinces were historically major gateways for foreign trade. Though inhabited by Han Chinese migrating from northern and central China in ancient times, the two regions are quite distinct socially, culturally, and geographically (Goodman & Feng, 1994). They were two major sending communities of overseas migration since ancient time, with the result that extensive Cantonese and Fujianese communities grew worldwide (Cartier, 2002). The inhabitants of these regions are renowned for their adventurous, ingenious, and entrepreneurial spirit. Another prominent feature distinguishing these two regions from other parts in China is patrilineal kinship in the form of lineages or clans, the basic social organization that featured prominently in single-surname villages in South China. As the eminent anthropolo-gist Freedman noted (1958), “The provinces Kwangtung [Guangdong]

and Fukien [Fujian] were remarkable in China for three things: large-scale lineage organization, inter-lineage fights, and secret societies of the Triad type.” Localized lineages used to wield significant influence across the entire fabrics of social, economic, political, financial, and religious life in rural South China (see Freedman, 1958). 10

Meanwhile, in the course of local economic development, intraprovincial discrepancies in growth are discernible in each of the two regions, due to differences in local circumstances and development strategies (Johnson, 1993; Lyonss, 1998). As the analysis in the previous section suggested, the re-emergence of Chinese underground banks

Chinese Underground Banks in China and the United States 23

is associated with the state’s rigid foreign exchange controls and shortage of capital among rapidly-growing private enterprises. As has been seen, underground banks tended to gain a foothold in these two regions, where a large number of thriving private enterprises generated great demand for credit as well as foreign exchange.

Compared with its affluent neighbors in the north (Zhejiang) and south (Guangdong), Fujian had been known as a poverty-stricken region prior to the reform era. Much of this is attributed to the mountainous terrain of its interior, and a high ratio of arable land to population (Yeung, 2000). Its strategic position as a front-line garrison as a result of military tension between mainland China and Taiwan had further worsened the economic stagnation in the province since 1949, which was due to a lack of investment from the central government in the development of heavy industry and infrastructure (Long, 2004). Fujian has regained its vitality and ascended to be one of the fastest-growing regions in China since the initiation of the reform. Fujian’s economic success followed a path similar to that of Guangdong. The development strategy pursued was oriented toward the establishment of labor-intensive, export-oriented processing and manufacturing industry (Chu & Yeung, 2000). The foreign direct investment behind Fujian’s economic takeoff stemmed from overseas Chinese, particularly from those of Fujian origin congregating in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and North America (Hu & Hu, 2000; Yeung, 2000).

This path of export-induced growth was crucial to shaping the spatial configuration of economic growth in Fujian in the reform era. The high-growth areas were clustered in the corridor along a north–south running coastline, with Fuzhou City, the capital city in the northeast, and Xiamen, one of the four Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in the far south serving as two major economic centers (Chu & Yeung, 2000). The surrounding rural towns near Fuzhou City have become the major sending communities for U.S.-bound human smuggling activities in the past two decades. Involvement in export-processing by rural enterprises gave a head start to highly concentrated rural towns and counties in the coastal regions, whose outstanding economic performance transformed these areas into emerging urban centers. Other rural regions located in the interior are relatively poor (Lyonss, 2000; Parish, 1994). Taken together, the uneven intraprovincial development of industrialization has resulted

24 Financing Illegal Migration

in spatial disparities in urbanization, which in turn may influence spatial patterns in the growth of underground banks.

Given the lack of systematic study on underground banks, police crackdowns on underground banks over the past decade offer valuable information, suggesting that underground banks appear to have thrived in the corridor of the Fujian–Xiamen coastal strip, their primary business scope encompassing lending, transactions in foreign and Chinese currency, and cross-border funds transfers. This spatial distribution of underground banks may not be a random occurrence.

Instead, it is more likely a reflection of the acute problems caused by China’s foreign exchange control policy, which was ill-suited to the rapid development of local economies. In those rapidly-growing areas which host the highest proportion of export-oriented joint ventures and private businesses in South China, foreign exchange controls have imposed serious constraints on the efficient operation of private businesses. Despite the liberalization tendency of foreign exchange controls policy over the last two decades, the tight controls at the core of the system remain virtually unchanged (Zhang, 2002).

Private enterprises’ growing demands for foreign exchange cannot be satisfied under the prevailing policy. Access to foreign exchange is still subject to official limitations, and enterprises are not allowed to command full control over their foreign currency earnings as a result of the strict enforcement of mandatory foreign exchange settlement and restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency (Drumm, 1995).

Worse still, the difficulty of obtaining loans from the state banks has been a chronic problem (Wolf et al., 2003).

Moreover, the inefficiency of services provided by banking institutions subjects them to considerable risk of loss and increased transaction costs. Under these circumstances, with their flexible and expedient service, underground banks present a far more feasible alternative to official channels for private enterprises, particularly medium-size and small firms. Consequently, it is the vibrant commercial and trading activities in the region that bring into high relief the conflict between supply of and demand for foreign currency, which has been exacerbated by China’s tight foreign exchange controls.

While state-run banks and government agencies fail to make foreign exchange and bank loans more accessible to foreign-invested firms, domestic private companies, and individual clients, underground banks step in to fill the breach.

Chinese Underground Banks in China and the United States 25

In sum, the magnitude of cross-border capital outflows and the scale of illicit lending through informal but illegal channels like underground banks bring to the foreground the problems with credit and foreign exchange facing a rapidly growing private sector. The underlying cause of these problems lies in the inadequacy of state policy and the structural rigidity of China’s financial systems. This raises questions as to whether the central government should consider adopting a strategy departing from repressive measures like the criminalizing of so-called irregular lending practices and foreign exchange dealings.

The current measures leave institutional deficiencies unscathed.

Underground banks in the migratory waves to the

United States

Chinatown migratory waves and the change in the patterns of Chinese immigration

As in Mainland China, the development of Chinese underground banks in the United States is not isolated from the larger historical and cultural context. The emergence of Chinese underground banks in Chinatown, New York, is inseparable from the immigration history and economic development of Chinatown. Chinatowns, which were founded around 1880 in the United States, have played a prominent role in the process of survival and prosperity for generations of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. The first generation of Chinese immigrants were contracted laborers widely known as

“coolies” in the West. They came to California from the coastal rural regions of Guangdong province at the onset of the Gold Rush and for the construction of the transcontinental railroad (Seagrave, 1995, p. 264; Zhou, 1992, pp. 19–27). The early Chinese immigrants, who were mostly married men leaving their families behind, sailed across the Pacific with the dream of finding fortune in the “golden mountain.” They were travelers, without any intention of settling in a world so foreign to them and starting a new life. They wanted to amass wealth for their families through hard work and return home with their hard-earned money (Seagrave, 1995, p. 265; Zhou, 1992, pp. 25–26). Subjected to demeaning working conditions, they toiled over the most difficult and dangerous manual work for lower- than-standard wages. When recession hit the West Coast in the 1880s, the ready accessibility of Chinese workers as cheap labor

26 Financing Illegal Migration

made them the subject of widespread resentment among the white working class, touching off the first large-scale anti-Chinese movement in American history (Zhou, 1992). Against a backdrop of racial discrimination the first Chinatown was established as a safe shelter in San Francisco, California, by the first generation of Chinese immigrants originating from Canton (now Guangdong province).

Chinatowns in Chicago and on the East Coast were built up later when Chinese immigrants moved eastward at a time of intensified discrimination (Zhou, 1992, pp. 19–27; Seagrave, 1995, p. 264).

The second wave of immigration was signaled by a monumental change in U.S. immigration law in 1965, which repealed discriminatory racial quotas. This brought in the largest influx of Chinese immigrants in the history of the U.S., driven by pervasive anxiety over potential threats due to political instability in Asia. The new arrivals were primarily from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other parts of Southeast Asia. The 1970s witnessed a total of 237,793 Chinese immigrants coming to the U.S. (Liang, 2001). These new Chinese immigrants were of more heterogeneous ethnic origins 11 and well-educated, and possessed professional skills and expertise. Many of them brought in financial capital to make investments in the U.S.

Unlike the early travelers, they came to stay permanently and aspired to achieve success in American society (Zhou, 1992, pp. 69–90).

Chinatowns have functioned as social, cultural, and economic enclaves for these Chinese immigrants in the process of adapting to a new environment and later assimilating into American society.

Closely-knit kinship networks were identified as central to the dynamics shaping Chinese communities in Chinatowns, buttressed by a strong ethnic economy (Zhou, 1992). The immigrants in return helped to boost the Chinatowns’ ethnic economy with their financial capital, labor, and social networks (Zhou, 1992, pp. 116–118).

A new trend in Chinese immigration was encouraged by the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) 12

and the executive orders issued by President Bush in 1989 and 1990.

The Amnesty provision and the political asylum program unleashed a new immigration frenzy among mainland Chinese (Chin, 1999; Hood, 1997), particularly the Fujianese. All illegal Fujianese who had stayed in the U.S. were given legal status, and a door was opened for legalized Fujianese immigrants to sponsor their immediate families and relatives into the U.S. under family reunification provisions.

Chinese Underground Banks in China and the United States 27

However, for a great number of Fujianese living in mainland China who were not eligible under immigration laws and policies, and for those who thought the waiting period for legal entry too lengthy or senseless, entry into the U.S. through human smuggling offered a better alternative. Thus began an era of illegal migration facilitated by multinational smuggling groups (Chin, 1999, pp. 49–79). The inflow of illegal Chinese into the U.S. peaked between 1988 and 1993 (Kwong, 1997, pp. 236–240; Myers, 1997, p. 113), with 10,000–

25,000 Fujianese estimated to be smuggled into the U.S. each year (Smith, 1997, pp. 60–77).

Chinatowns’ economy and illegal immigration

Since the 1960s, Chinatowns have been highly successful in transforming themselves from self-contained niches insulated from the larger American society into thriving ethnic economies (Zhou, 1992, p. 91). With a continuous flow of immigrants, Chinatown in New York City has gained a vibrant life, spurred by a strong ethnic economy. The population and residential boundaries have grown to include what were originally Jewish and Italian neighborhoods, expanding from an original three-block area into more than 20 blocks of the Lower East Side of Manhattan (Kinkead, 1992), with satellite Chinatowns springing up in Queens and Brooklyn (Zhou, 1992, pp. 186–192). By all indications, ethnic businesses in Chinatown possess the distinctive features of an enclave economy, where a specific ethnic group is overrepresented in terms of place of residence, place of work, and industry sectors (Zhou & Logan, 1989). 13

Much of the tremendous growth of the Chinatown economy can be attributed to the defining features of the economic enclaves (Zhou, 1992): an influx of financial capital brought by new immigrants; the steady growth of the population, representing a potential both as workers and as customers in the post-1965 immigration reform era; and more recent immigration beginning in the later 1980s. In response to the demands of this rapidly growing ethnic market, the economy in Chinatowns has diversified into a wide range of commercial endeavors and production activities, of which restaurants, garment industries, and the wholesale and retail trade are key sectors. Most Chinese-run businesses are either owned by sole proprietors or are family-based establishments, hiring predominantly ethnic laborers. They cater to the specialized needs of a

28 Financing Illegal Migration

Chinese clientele as well as to those of the wider American population. The keys to the success of the enclave economy include easy access to ethnic finance, low production costs due to a stable supply of cheap labor, and reliance on kinship networks for utilizing the large labor pool and diminishing potential employer–employee clashes (Zhou, 1992, pp. 91–118).

Chinatowns’ thriving economies are strongly correlated with the employment of co-ethnics, particularly Chinese illegal immigrants (Chin, 1999; Kwong, 1997). 14 The enclave economy provides greater likelihood for self-employment for those immigrants who accumulate sufficient financial capital and labor skill after years of toiling to escape from dead-end jobs and move up the occupational ladder (Portes & Bach, 1985). For unskilled new immigrants with poor language ability and low educational attainment, these opportunities are of great significance. The other side of the issue is that for small businesses within an enclave to succeed, maintaining an ample supply of low-wage workers is crucial (Sanders & Nee, 1987, p. 764).

Illegal immigrants like smuggled Fujianese are the least costly and the most tractable group, because employment in the ethnic economy of Chinatown is the only choice available to them (Kwong, 1997).

Thriving ethnic business ventures in Chinatown are able to create and sustain various employment opportunities for Chinese immigrants. Job opportunities allow unauthorized Fujianese to survive and save money for their families in China, and the growth of the ethnic economy in turn is maintained through the avail-ability of the cheap and reliable labor force. For these people, who are poorly-educated and unskilled or low-skilled, and cannot speak English, their only assets are their kinship and community ties.

Through these ties, they become the ideal recruits for those labor-intensive, low-wage businesses clustering in Chinatowns. These Chinese illegal immigrants usually find employment in menial occupations with little upward mobility, receive pay that is lower than minimum wage rates, work under miserable conditions for more than 10 hours per day, six or seven days per week, and live in overcrowded tenements. Their goals are to pay back the debts they owe for the exorbitant smuggling fees and send their earnings in the U.S. back to support their families. Even years after they get out of debt, they are still responsible for contributing to their family incomes back in China.

The rise of Fujianese communities in Chinatown, NYC

Following the enactment of the Amnesty provision contained in the IRCA in 1986 and President Bush’s 1989 political asylum program, illegal immigration from Fujian Province abruptly surged. Statistics obtained through a census by the Fuzhou municipal government suggest that 450,000 Fujianese reside in the U.S., among whom 300,000 settled in New York State while the remaining 140,000 are scattered around the U.S. (Lin, 2005). The largest group of Fujianese, approximately 60,000 to 70,000, is concentrated in New York City (Guest, 2003). However, the figure could be underestimated according to pastors and other informants who work closely with Fujianese illegals. The number of Fujianese immigrants scattered around the U.S. could be as high as 600,000. 15 To obtain and corrob-orate an accurate estimate of the magnitude of the illegal Fujianese population is a difficult task because of the reluctance of a significant segment of the illegal population to be identified or to come out to seek assistance from social service providers such as a local Fujianese church.

With a large number of Fujianese illegals flowing into the U.S.

through smuggling since the late 1980s, the ethnic economy and the composition of the resident population have undergone a remarkable change. Because of their social capital and financial resources accumulated over the past two decades, Fujianese have begun to start up new businesses, take over the fast-food industry, and penetrate into the garment industry, the two sectors previously dominated by the earlier generations of immigrants from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The businesses of take-out restaurants and buffet restaurants in NYC have virtually come under the control of Fujianese immigrants. By 1997, Fujianese immigrants were reported to own 150 garment factories out of an estimated total of 600 in Chinatown (“The emergence of Fujianese,” 1997). These immigrants have also claimed an increasingly large share of the service sector, such as food wholesalers and real estate companies, to accommodate the needs of the quickly expanding catering industry (“Fujianese dominate,”

1998). Fujianese firms also tend to concentrate on the construction business. Other type of service also blossom to serve this newest immigrant groups, including employment agencies, wedding planning businesses, grocery stores, barber shops and beauty salons, and immigration consultancy offices (Chin, 1999 ).

Another distinct sign of the strong presence of this latest immigrant group in Chinatown is the ubiquity of Fujianese community organizations. Primarily they include native-place-based tongxian-ghui (fellow-villager associations) organized by people who originate in a village or a town in Fujian. It will not come as a surprise that all these associations carry the names of the places which are the leading sources of human smuggling in Fujian, including Changle, Lianjiang, Tingjiao, Langqi, Houyu, and Fuqing. Another type is zongqinhui (clan associations), in which members belong to a kinship group which shares the same surname (Christiansen, 2003).

The umbrella associations set up in the early 1990s, including the United Chinese Association of New York and the United Fujianese of American Association, increasingly present a political challenge to the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, the pro-Taiwanese Cantonese immigrant organization which has been the leading civic and community association of Chinatown for more than a hundred years (LII , 1997). Over the past two decades, the number of Fujianese community associations has surged from the original two dozen to over one hundred (Zeng, 2007), making them the major force behind the Fujianese assertion of political standing and power in Chinatown politics.

The formation of two main arteries – Canal Street, still dominated by Cantonese, and East Broadway, widely known as Fuzhou Main Street – is emblematic of the changing landscape in Chinatown, shaped by the ascending economic power of Fujianese immigrants and the receding influence of the Cantonese (Lee, 2006). Their spatial dispersion is also a reliable indicator of the aggressive expansion of the Fujianese. Over the past decades, Eighth Avenue, Brooklyn, a predominantly Cantonese commercial district, has witnessed the establishment of another rapidly growing Fujianese settlement beyond the Manhattan Chinatown, as a result of the steady influx of Fujianese immigrants drawn by lower rents than those available in old Chinatown (Lin, 2005; Shen, 2004 ).

The haven of underground banks: East Broadway,

Chinatown, NYC

The ethnic economic niches and expansive networks established at the heart of NYC makes the city a huge magnet for illegal immigrants from Fujian Province, who are smuggled into the U.S. in search of

Chinese Underground Banks in China and the United States 31

employment. Thriving businesses established through the continuous arrival of Fujianese illegal immigrants have brought vitality to an originally obscure area with its dilapidated blocks under the Manhattan Bridge around East Broadway at the southeastern section of Chinatown (Crow, 2003). Known as Fuzhou Town, the area is clut-tered with stalls and stores, indoor bazaars, and tenement buildings, and is frequented by people who speak the same dialect, Fuzhounese.

Fujianese have left an indelible imprint on Chinatown, and more importantly, they have carved out territory of their own, a town within the town. This area is known as Fuzhou Town in the local Chinese community, and East Broadway is also dubbed as “Fuzhou Street.”

The smell, the noise of the street, the store signs and decorations, the way people dress and talk, all closely resemble a rural market town in Fujian. Along the bustling streets, Fuzhounese-speaking workers go about their business on their day off, and they rarely fail to find their needs met by the rich variety of services available to them, be it specialty food, a haircut, wiring money back home, Chinese DVDs for rent, international phone cards, wedding banquet arrangements, or even sex workers in massage parlors (Sachs, 2001). As for where these Fujianese males hail from, the researcher was told affirmatively that “at least 95 percent of Fujianese men walking on the street were smuggled in here.” Indeed, according to a recent report, the particular street corner in East Broadway (location kept purposely vague) turns out to be a terminal stop for the recently developed smuggling routes, where relatives of those smuggled Fujianese would come and pick them up (“The newest route for Chinese smuggling groups,”

2008 ). No one knows how long the location may have served this specific function unnoticed.

In addition to its being a commercial center, the rising need of Fujianese workers to be ferried to and from work in restaurants across the U.S. has made East Broadway into a transportation hub.

Fujianese are a highly mobile people, and many new arrivals do not settle in one place. After entering illegally into the U.S. by tortuous, sometimes perilous, international migration routes, Fujianese quickly open up internal migration routes for the workers to move on to restaurants in different states across the U.S. (Morgan, 2006), turning NYC, their first entry port, into a departure point.

For Fujianese workers who do not speak English, cities and towns outside NYC do not have names such as Washington, D.C., Atlanta,

32 Financing Illegal Migration

Columbus, or Philadelphia; they are collectively referred to as

“ waizhou ” (meaning “out of state”), which is represented by a string of area codes as the main geographical identifiers of restaurants seeking helping hands (Luo, 2006

). Chinese-run bus companies

advertise the destination and the fare like this: “Minnesota (612, 952, 763) US$150; Wisconsin (920, 608, 414) US$120.” (“Chinese immigrants kept the US well fed,” 2005 ).

The frequent travel and geographic distance simply reinforce the status of NYC as the home base in the hearts of Fujianese workers.

A Fujianese restaurant worker described his feelings in this way:

“For people like us who don’t speak any English, New York is what a mother’s home would be for her married daughters!” This respondent also said:

When I worked in waizhou and had a day off, my Fujianese friends and I would go up to New York. ’Cause we didn’t have relatives nor knew anybody up there at the time, we just pooled money and bunked in one of the $60–70 per month rooms in the privately-owned tenement advertised in Chinese newspapers in NYC, and had some fun for a day at NYC.

It appears that East Broadway in Chinatown truly gives an identity to the Fujianese community, which is primarily composed of illegal immigrants, by serving as the hub of commercial activities, a home retreat for those working outside NYC, and maybe a shelter for smugglers (Harder, 2001). The sheer number and density of both Fujianese migrant workers and Fujianese-dominated businesses create a comfort zone in the area for both the owners of underground banks and their clients, Fujianese illegals, to conduct transactions there. It is not surprising that the area near East Broadway, Chinatown has become a haven to the qianzhuangs visited by the interviewees.

Summary

A historal overview suggests that underground banking systems originated from indigeneous banks, which used to hold a pre- eminent place in furthering the development of China’s commerce, trade, and financing between the 18th century and first half of the 20th century.

They were started to accommodate customers’ needs by engagning

Chinese Underground Banks in China and the United States 33

in issuing notes and credit and dealing in money exchange. These informal financing channels were closed down over the course of three decades with state-run banks monopolizing the financial sector under auspices of the Communist Chinese government. It was not until the early 1980s, when an open policy and market-oriented economic reform swept China, that underground banks were able to stage a comeback. A large number of thriving small and medium-sized private enterprises in South China generated growing demand for foreign currency and financing by expanding the local economy.

However, China’s stringent foreign exchange controls, financing practices biased against the private sector, and the inefficiency of the state banking sector created institutional restraints which posed an insurmountable obstacle to the rapid development of private sector.

Informal but illegal financing ventures like underground banks were more sensitive to the need of the burgeoning market among private enterprises, and stepped in to fill the need with their easy accessibility, flexibility, versaltility, and efficiency of financial services.

China’s open policy also created an impetus to a large-scale legal as well as illegal immigration flow into the United States and other Western countries. Chinese illegal immigration was facilitated by international smuggling groups. The continuous inflow of Chinese migrants brought about tremendous changes to the economic contour of Chinatowns in the U.S. With the flood of financial capital and labor skills brought in by new immigrants, Chinatowns witnessed a rapidly growing enclave economy, which produced abun-dant job opportunities for Chinese illegal immigrants. An important outgrowth of the recent immigratory wave starting in the late 1980s was the strong presence of Fujianese, which over the years began to expand and dominate the key sectors of the ethnic economy in Chinatown , NYC ranging from restaurants and garment manufac-ture to construction. This powerful community gradually carved out a Fuzhou town at the heart of Chinatown, NYC, buttressed by their economic niches and expansive ethnic networks . In the midst of bustling commercial activiites, Fuzhou Town not only sheltered newly arrived Fujianese illegal immigrants, but also became a safe haven for undertakings like underground banks.

Main Clientele and Operators of

Underground Banks: Analysis and

Findings

The revival of Chinese underground banks during China’s post-reform era after a nearly three-decade hiatus has been a subject of interest for the government and scholars alike. Various reports have indicated that they have played a significant role in the rapid growth of private enterprises by acting as loan-makers, informal foreign exchange dealers, and remitting agencies, through which large amounts of money have been moved domestically as well as across borders (Tsai, 2002). The operation of underground banks in China has been prohibited since 1998 1 and has been considered illegal in some states of the U.S. However, there is a lack of systematic research tracking the evolution of these informal financing systems, and no reliable investigation has been conducted into underground banking systems with regard to their connection with illegal and criminal activities. Information found in police records presents limited evidence concerning these activities. Needless to say, the perspectives of the clients of underground banks have rarely found a place in scholarly examination or in news reports.

Drawing on in-depth interviews of 27 clients of underground banks, this study explores the role of Chinese-operated underground banking systems located in the U.S. from the perspectives of their clientele, who were mostly illegal immigrants (Zhao, 2012

). The

27 respondents recruited for this research arrived illegally in the U.S.

in different years between 1988 and 2004. All have had the experience of using both formal channels, i.e. banks or licensed money 34

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 35

transfer operators such as Western Union, and informal channels, to which Fujianese immigrants attach different names: “ qianzhuang ”

(money shops), “private banks,” “money-remitting places,” or even more tersely by connecting the owner’s name to it, such as “Sister Ping’s shop.” 2

The narrative data of the clients of underground banks illustrate their personal experiences of using the informal financial systems and their views of the illegal service and service providers. They also are crucial in revealing the conditions under which demand surfaced for the illegal services provided by Chinese underground banks, and how the change of external environment impinged on the operation of the systems. First, this chapter focuses on the basic characteristics of two transactional parties: the clients and the purveyors of illegal services, i.e. the underground bank owners or operators. The clients’

accounts are used to address the following questions in depth: Why are the services of underground banks preferred over other alternatives? Do the narrative data identify any differences in the operating style of underground banks over the past decades?

Main clientele of underground banks: Fujianese

illegal immigrants

This research confirms the findings of my preliminary research, that underground banks located in Chinatown, NYC, apparently limited their business scope to deal with remittance transfers from the U.S.

to Fujian, China,

3 and exclusively served their fellow Fujianese

immigrants, including both those with illegal and legal status who originated from rural areas near Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province. Nonetheless, the main clientele were Fujianese illegal immigrant workers. According to the respondents’ accounts, they used 11 underground banks for the purposes of remitting back home their earnings generated from their illegal employment in the U.S.

The respondents’ narratives suggested that the main objectives for undocumented Fujianese immigrant workers were to save their earnings and send them back home for smuggling debt repayment and to support their families. Previous research showed that Fujianese immigrants cannot afford the exorbitant smuggling fees without loans from families, relatives, or friends (Chin, 1999). When debt repayment falls behind, interest accrued to the principal will add an

36 Financing Illegal Migration

extra burden to the immigrant workers, and in some cases gets their guarantors or their family members into serious trouble (Kotlowitz, 2006). In emigrant communities where married women do not go out to work by local tradition in rural Fujian, remitted funds sent from their husbands working in the U.S. are the main sources of family income. Therefore, how remittances were to be transferred back safely and quickly, and what factors shaped the decision-making of undocumented workers, are concerns of considerable importance.

Since they serve both as participants in Fujianese-dominated smuggling activities and as the main clientele of the Fujianese-controlled underground banking systems, the singular status of Fujianese illegal immigrants deserves some brief comments. Instead of the question why the rural counties in the vicinity of the provincial city Fuzhou became a hub of transnational illegal immigration, the central issue here is what distinguishes Fujianese, or, more precisely, Fuzhounese immigrants4, from other immigrant groups of ethnic Chinese living in the U.S. Fujianese immigrants’ experiences of human smuggling are well-documented in a series of research studies and governmental reports (see Chin, 1999; Kwong, 1997; Pieke et al., 2004). However, what might be characterized as a particular disposition towards involvement in illegitimate and even criminal activities among this ethnic group is an interesting domain to explore. An overview of the history in trade and emigration and the recent development of Fuzhou City reveals an answer embedded in a blend of a unique culture and its openness to global influence.

The region is notable for a maritime tradition beginning in ancient times thanks to its geographic position as a gateway to Southeast Asia.

Fuzhou’s long-standing involvement in international trade can be traced to the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The early success of Fujianese merchants helped extend their trade and community networks in Southeast Asia. After the Opium War of 1840–1842, Fuzhou was designated along with four other Chinese coastal cities as a treaty port open to Western trade and residence, thus becoming subject to exposure to Western influences (Pieke et al., 2004). In the 19th century Fuzhou was also used as one of the major ports for recruiting Chinese laborers into the “coolie trade” to meet the growing demand for cheap labor in the colonial economy in Southeast Asia (Cartier, 2001). The local native people established a seafaring legacy and cultivated an adventurous spirit in the century-old economic and

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 37

labor emigration and the process of negotiating a new world (Chin, 2003). The legacy has been carried on by the new generation of Fuzhounese immigrants, particularly illegal workers, in the more recent migratory movement of the last quarter of the 20th century.

During the emigration process, a collective identity was forged in that Fuzhounese immigrants gained a reputation as an ethnic group marked by strong identification with a shared native place and dialect, and ties of sanguinity (Piek et al., 2004; Zheng, 2005).

According to the present research, the shared identity claimed by Fuzhounese illegal immigrants figured prominently in sustaining the smooth operation of underground banks in a foreign society.

Another common trait of considerable influence in fueling unauthorized emigration was the elevated aspirations characteristic of this ethnic group. Higher expectations directly stem from the transformation of the sending regions as well as what the entire province has gone through since the onset of the “open” policy and the economic reforms beginning in the late 1970s. People’s aspirations surged as the sending regions came to rank among the most affluent in the province, primarily a result of continuous donations and investments from restored overseas links in Southeast Asia (Hood, 1997; Lyonss, 2000). Increased contact with nearby overseas regions like Taiwan and Hong Kong heightened local residents’ desire to get rich (Chu & Ngan, 2000). These raised aspirations define local culture to such an extent that overseas migration is prescribed as the quick path to wealth and status, rendering alternative options inferior and even a sign of failure (Hood, 1997; Pieke et al., 2004, p. 194).

Equally important, prior research on Chinese illegal immigration also identifies a culturally structured perception ingrained among Fuzhounese immigrants that their family duty justifies the use of any means necessary to improve the family’s economic well-being and social status, including seeking the service of human smugglers to arrange for family members’ illegal entry into the United States and other countries (Chin, 1999; Hood, 1997; Zheng, 2005). Over nearly two decades of investigation and crackdowns on human smuggling originating from Asia, governments, scholars, and observers would probably be in agreement that this ethnic group is the most tena-cious and resourceful in defiance of governmental immigration regulations and laws, since they are able to marshal so many resources in attempts to illegally cross borders and establish Fujianese settlements

38 Financing Illegal Migration

anywhere they desire (e.g. Chin, 2003; Kotlowitz, 2006; Salt & Stein, 1997; Smith, 1997 ).

Contemporary remittance market in the U.S.

As distinct from the older generations, the new generations of Fujianese immigrants are undocumented laborers in the U.S. That means they have to cope with the constraints posed by this illegal status when it comes to sending remittances home. Conventional views hold that Fujianese illegal immigrants turned to underground banks because of their lack of legal status, and also because alternative options might not exist. Others believe that coercion by smuggling groups may play a role in their decisions. The answers given by the majority of the respondents in this study seem to dispute these widely held views. To understand the motives of illegal immigrants for using underground banks, it is necessary to look into whether a lack of legal status posed a serious problem for fund transfers among Fujianese illegal immigrants after a massive number of Fujianese landed in the U.S. by illegal entry.

A sizable portion of illegal immigrants arrived in the U.S. without legal documents. For these people, underground banks were the only available means of transmitting remittances back home. However, the findings suggest that this explanation does not present a full picture as to why underground banks appealed to a whole group of illegal immigrants. According to the respondents in this study, in the 1990s Chinese banks located in Chinatown did not ask their customers for identification showing proof of lawful presence in the U.S. Instead, they permitted the use of other equivalent identification documents such as a passport or a temporary work permit issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for remitting purposes. Also, a significant number of Fujianese illegals were likely holders of authentic Chinese passports, thanks to the “full package deal” provided by smugglers (Pieke et al., 2004). More than half of the respondents in this research held Chinese passports at the time of transactions with qianzhuang . Those who did not possess a passport were able to obtain a new passport or other identification documents in two ways. They could apply to the Consulate General of P.R. China in NYC for a new passport through Chinese-operated travel agencies and immigration business service centers. 5 The second way was through the asylum claim procedure, whereby a different

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 39

set of identification documents would be issued by the American government. Those new documents include a C-8 card, a temporary work permit issued directly by the INS upon approval of an asylum seeker, or by a local reviewing court pending the final decision if the initial application was rejected by the INS. An A-5 card is issued as a work permit to an applicant after an asylum application has been approved. An immigrant would obtain a social security card after the A-5 card is issued.

Recent arrivals were advised to pursue an asylum claim immediately after setting their feet on the soil of the U.S., even though the lack of these legal documents was not an obstacle for Fujianese in finding employment with ethnic businesses. According to the respondents, all of them had the same experience of applying for asylum, regardless of their year of arrival. They learned from fellow Fujianese or smugglers that claiming asylum is the only viable means of obtaining secure status in the U.S. The issue of bogus asylum claims aside, normally every Fujianese illegal immigrant would apply for asylum soon upon their arrival, and a significant proportion of Fujianese immigrants have been granted asylum on grounds of political and religious persecution (Chin, 1999; Kwong, 1997). Statistics indicate that from 1990 to 2001, China ranked as the fourth largest country of origin of asylum seekers in the U.S., after El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico (Castles & Loughna, 2005). Official figures of Fujianese asylum applicants are not available; however, though they arrived in the U.S. in different years, the accounts of the respondents were consistent: a significant proportion of Fujianese illegal immigrants were able to obtain legal identification documents by seeking asylum. This avenue, open to Fujianese illegals, at least removed a major hindrance for the purpose of remitting money home through banks among illegal immigrants.

Unsuprisingly, the welcoming attitude of local banks in Chinatown toward illegal immigrants was reportedly profit driven. The actual size of the monetary flow into local communities in Fujian from the U.S. deriving from Fujianese immigrants’ wages, referred to as

“migradollars” by scholars on international labor migration (Massey

& Parrado, 1994), is difficult to estimate because there is good reason to believe that a substantial proportion of remittances were not recorded, since they passed through informal remittance mechanisms (Hernandez-Coss, 2006; Higazi, 2005). An American political

40 Financing Illegal Migration

scientist who studied local informal financial institutions in Fujian was told by a local official in Changle that over $300 million in remittances arrived in 1995 from overseas Changle workers alone (Tsai, 2002, p. 77). 6 A news report in 2005 claimed that the daily flow of overseas remittance receipts stood at $1.2 million in Changle city (Shi, 2005). Scholars suggest that the amount of undocumented remittances is estimated to be no less than those flowing through formal channels (Hernandez-Coss, 2006; Higazi, 2005). With massive numbers of Fujianese illegals landing in Chinatown, the emergent remittance market opened up new business opportunities for banks and other formal financial institutions, prompting them to reach out to Fujianese illegal migrant workers by setting up branches in Chinatown.

The major Chinese-American bank branches operating in Chinatown, NYC, with which Fujianese immigrants have been familiar since the 1990s, include Abacus Federal Savings Bank (Guobao Yinhang), Great Eastern Bank (Guandong Yinhang), 7

Cathay Bank (Guotai Yinhang), and some other banks which later disappeared through a series of bank mergers and acquisitions . In the early years, these banks primarily served the clients who spoke Cantonese and Taiwanese, and did not open up businesses targeting the new immigrant group until around the mid-1990s. The Bank of China (BOC),

8 the only state-owned bank from mainland

China, and qianzhuangs were probably the frontrunners vying for market shares among Fujianese illegal immigrants, according to the accounts of the respondents. In order to attract more clients, BOC

took advantage of the then lax regulatory regime, extending remitting services to Fujianese immigrants as long as they were able to show an identification document of some sort, be it a Chinese passport, C-8 card, or A-5 card. Soon Abacus Bank followed BOC’s lead.

The competition must have been intense because both banks raised the cash threshold under which no identification was required for the remitted amounts from $2,000 to $3,000 , as shown by the experience of the respondents who were clients of these two banks in 1993 and 1995 respectively. Thus, Fujianese illegal immigrants did have access to regulated financial channels for transferring funds home. Yet, in competing for the attention of potential clients the formal sector was clearly not on par with Chinese underground banks, due to lack of ethnic connections to Fujianese immigrants

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 41

and the poor quality of service as compared to underground banks.

According to an older respondent, Mr. Chu, 9 who arrived in NYC in 1993, the reason why Fujianese used the service of qianzhuang in the early 1990s had little to do with their lack of legal status, much less with coercion from the smuggling groups or gangs in NYC.

At the time there were only two places open to us, the Bank of China and

qianzhuangs . The BOC allowed us to open a bank account with a passport. We liked qianzhuang better because the money got back home much faster. Of course at a qianzhuang an ID

was not required at all, and no paperwork was needed. It was run by a Fujianese who had a household name. The cashiers all spoke Fujianese. So we did not need to worry about where our money wound up. More important, I did not want to leave any record of my income with a formal bank. In a word, they [ qianzhuang ] are just more convenient.

Other respondents expressed similar views. One respondent even shifted to the use of an underground bank immediately after he was reminded of the legal risks of using formal banks by a fellow Fujianese. The differences in the quality of service also made the formal banking systems user-unfriendly. Underground banks had a more flexible operation schedule. For instance, Sister Ping’s qianzhuang was open from 9 to 8, seven days a week. And they were much faster in transferring funds from the U.S. to China. It took at least half a month for BOC to send remittances to Fujian, whereas money transferred through

qianzhuangs arrived the next day, or

within a few days at most. Qianzhuangs usually had an agent in the major emigrant towns in Fujian, who would arrange a delivery to individual households without any additional charge, as noted by one respondent.

According to the

guiju [policy] of a

qianzhuang , the fee they

charged varied dependent on the amount you remitted. Plus, the fee was actually higher with Sister Ping’s

qianzhuang [in

Chinatown, NYC] than that of the Bank of China. But I think the dealings with qianzhuangs were more fair because they arranged the money delivery to our families for free. If our family went to the BOC to collect money sent from the U.S., they would charge

42 Financing Illegal Migration

us 30 yuans [$3.60]. That means, we were charged twice. Sister Ping’s qianzhuang in Fujian never ran business like that.

In addition, there was no BOC branch in small cities or towns.

Most of the respondents’ families were in rural areas, meaning they had to travel as far as the capital city to pick up the money; needless to say, they had to bear costs incurred by transportation as well as additional fees charged by the local BOC branch. The complaints of Fujianese immigrants were also directed at the bureaucratic practices of local BOC branches.

My wife was told again and again by the bank clerk that the money hadn’t arrived yet. She said sometimes money didn’t even come in after one month was past! And every time she went to the bank, she had to wait in a long, slow line. To wait for more than one hour was not unusual. And they also charged us 30 yuans!

Another important aspect that made the BOC lose its edge in competition against qianzhuangs was China’s strict foreign exchange control. One respondent explained why he thought the use of qianzhuangs both in Fujian and in Chinatown was a better choice.

In those days [the early 1990s], nobody was allowed to keep foreign money in China. So if you sent your dollars home through a BOC here in Chinatown, your family could only get Chinese yuan from a BOC branch in Fuzhou City at a bad exchange rate.

But U.S. dollars were haoyong [more valuable] in China at the time.

The price [disparities] between the official exchange rate and black market rate were quite large. 10 You could sell your remittances on the black market for a better price, getting nine yuans or more for one US dollar. So I figured it was more worthwhile putting my money through Sister Ping’s qianzhuang .

A misconception spread through the media and research was that Chinese IFTs gained wide popularity among poor illegal immigrants because they charged a much lower rate than formal banks. The evidence collected from this research suggests otherwise. For a money transfer, agency transaction costs consist of two categories: service fees and a commission charged for foreign currency conversion. But

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 43

according to the respondents, the money their families picked up at a local branch of a qianzhuang in Fujian province was in US dollars.

According to one response, that was because “everybody wanted American dollars at the time! They were hot: one dollar is worth a lot more than one Chinese yuan.”

So the commission fee was saved for the clients. The service fee was on average US$18–20 per $1000 at qianzhuangs , while it was lower, around $15, with BOC. 11 According to the respondents, the rate was set by the qianzhuangs , and was not negotiable during the course of transactions. However, given that the vast majority of Fujianese illegal immigrants were in debt and desired to get out of debt as quickly as possible, qianzhuangs ’ fast delivery, even charged at higher rates, was nothing less than a boon. One respondent, who obtained a loan of $26,000 for his smuggling fee at an interest rate of 2 percent, and arrived in the U.S. in the late 1980s, put it in this way: I had to pay an additional 1,000 yuan [$120] for interest if repayment fell behind! My family was already burdened with the smuggling debt; I was really not able to afford the delay if my money were sent through the BOC.

Furthermore, the respondents’ accounts appeared to suggest that coercive force was not at work here. But in a few cases the practices of smugglers could compel Fujianese to turn to a qianzhuang . For example, smugglers might not return a client’s passport even at the end of a smuggling trip simply because the client had failed to meet the schedule to pay the remainder of the smuggling fee. A respondent who arrived in the US in 2004 said that he had to inquire about where he could send money home without a passport, since the smuggler held his passport for a long while. His Fuzhounese friends referred him to three qianzhuangs located on East Broadway to solve the problem of remitting money without ID. 12

The service available from local Chinese banks, another two informal channels were also open for Fujianese illegal immigrants.

They could either wire money through the accounts of legalized Fujianese with banks or the Western Union, or ask returning or visiting Fujianese to carry their money on their return trips, i.e. so-called pocket transfers. The good part about the pocket transfers was that there was no processing fee. However, these were not

44 Financing Illegal Migration

ideal arrangements from the point of view of some Fujianese illegals. First, both Western Union and banks set caps on the amount that could be remitted within a month; if the total amount wired was in excess of $10,000, they tended to look into the source of the money flowing through the account. A couple of legalized respondents complained that they had received notification from a money transfer operator (Western Union) that their accounts had been frozen pending investigation because Fujianese friends of theirs without legal status had used the accounts to wire money totaling approximately $30,000 within two months.

Second, during the early 1990s, the number of legalized Fujianese immigrants was relatively small, which means that not many people were able to travel back and forth freely between the U.S. and China.

Even when the number of returnees gradually increased later on, pocket transfers could be a source of trouble, as one respondent explained:

You see, we usually entrust a friend or fellow townsfolk with our money when he goes back to China. If something bad happens on the trip back, and money gets lost, are you gonna blame him? Of course not! He is just a friend who offers to help. Asking for compensation would embarrass both of us. That is no good at all!

Another respondent pointed out another risk inherent in the pocket transfer:

Isn’t there a Customs regulation saying how much cash one person is allowed to carry with him? What if he gets caught with too much cash on his belt when he passes through the check-point? I don’t want to lose my money at the hands of the Customs officials!

Another reason for using underground banks was associated with a peculiar mentality shared by some immigrants, as suggested by the statement of one respondent: “I don’t want to owe other people renqing debt; it is better to count on myself.”

Literally, “

renqing ” means “human feelings,” but there is more to it in the Chinese culture. Renqing is a byproduct of reciprocal

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 45

obligations in the process of building social networks, in which one party asks a favor of another (as in the case of asking a returning fellow Fujianese to take money back or wiring money through a legalized Fujianese’s account), and the second party obligingly honors the request. Implicitly, the beneficiary is thereafter obliged to repay the favor to the second party by offering some “service” of equal or greater value. If he or she does not meet this expectation, they will probably be an object of disdain and risk being excluded from their circle of friends or acquaintances. However, the problem is that it is not easy to gauge what constitutes equal or equivalent value when returning the favor. Thus the ambiguity inherent in the process of favor exchange strains the interpersonal relationships among friends and acquaintances in China. The reaction of most respondents was that they tried not to use these alternative options unless they were left with no other choices.

Most respondents admitted that they needed to send money home through underground banks on a regular basis before their debt was cleared. The amount of remitted funds was dependent on the stability of their jobs and their income level for a specific year. The estimated amount of remittances ranged between $500 and $1,000

for most respondents each time they visited a qianzhuang , and the total of remittances was estimated at between $6,000 and $12,000

a year. The average proportions allocated for remittance accounted for 80 percent to 90 percent of their monthly income. The average duration of using qianzhuang was two to three years. For most of the respondents who came to the U.S. prior to 1995, when the smuggling fee was much lower than the current going rate on the market (approximately $70,000 per head between 2007 and 2008), this was roughly equivalent to the time required to clear smuggling debts.

The majority of respondents used only one underground bank, and they would make a habit of continuing to use the same qianzhuang , instead of shopping around. Limited sources of information and the quality of the services offered by the qianzhuang they used could be the reasons for their decision to stick to only one qianzhuang .

Taken together, the emergence of qianzhuangs in Chinatown, NYC, appears to be a market response to Fujianese illegal immigrants’

special needs, not necessarily caused directly by lack of legal status or absence of legal avenues for fund transfer. Instead, it was a response to the impediments which they were confronted with: one is the

46 Financing Illegal Migration

fear of leaving any paper trail of transactions with formal banks; the second, the need to clear smuggling debt within the shortest period possible. “Convenience” is the most frequently mentioned remark by the respondents on the services of qianzhuang . The respondents used the services of qianzhaung in remitting money home. Compared with formal channels, the easy accessibility, expediency, and anonymity of qianzhuangs made them a preferable choice among Fujianese illegal immigrants. My data suggest that Fujianese-operated underground banks specialized in solving specific problems for illegal immigrants by offering a “unique” service, thus enabling them to serve undocumented immigrant workers better than official banks.

Individuals operating underground banks and

operating style

The evidence derived from the personal experiences of the clients may serve as a basis for drawing inferences about when the services of underground banks started in Chinatown in New York City.

According to several older respondents, the qianzhuangs appeared to emerge around 1990 or 1991, while the most recent use of a qianzhuang occurred around 2005 . The total number of suppliers of these services throughout the past decade will probably remain a permanent mystery. Adding up the number of qianzhuangs accessed by the respondents at different times from the early 1990s up to the mid-2000s, the respondents used 11 qianzhuangs concentrated in the

“Fuzhou Town” area, Chinatown. 13 The informants’ accounts suggest that in most cases a local qianzhuang did not have any identifiable store sign, but some of them did spot a sign on the door frame of a store, reading “Express Remitting Service.” These establishments either were confined to a counter in a store selling clothing and other consumer goods, or could be found in a street-front store which sold cell phones or phone cards, or in a family-run hostel.

The business premises for these qianzhuangs , not quite as their name implies, were usually small and cramped. Blending well in a confusing maze of shops selling clothing, produce, and jewelry, with a humble-looking frontage, they probably would not catch a passer-by’s eyes if he or she had not been tipped off beforehand. Two respondents were not even sure whether the qianzhuang they used had any business premises. They used different

qianzhuangs – in

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 47

Philadelphia and Chinatown, NYC, respectively – but their impression of the premises of qianzhuang was similar: I have never been to the store. They would call first [or in the other respondent’s case, it was she who called first after arriving at her friend’s place in Chinatown], then they sent somebody to pick up my money. That is it. I doubted if there was a store out there.

However, what could be said with certainty for all respondents is that the proprietors were invariably Fujianese immigrants, all of whom came from mainland China (except for one Fujianese emigrant from Hong Kong). Qianzhuangs were operated by and staffed with Fuzhounese-speaking Fujianese. Naturally, the transactions were conducted in Fujianese dialect. In most cases, the respondents knew certain personal information of the owners: the name (or at least the surname), the place of origin, and, most importantly, the reputation of the proprietors of qianzhuangs they used. In other cases they claimed that they knew nothing but the fact that the owner was a fellow Fujianese. However, not every respondent was willing to confess that they had knowledge of the reputed connections of a qianzhuang with human smuggling or any other shady businesses.

As one respondent explained, “we are not nosy people; we just care about whether our money can be sent back home safely.”

The evidence suggests that the reputation of a qianzhuang is of particular concern for potential clients. The better the reputation of a proprietor, the greater would be the likelihood of attracting clients, the more clients he or she would draw in, the longer and more steady business relations would be with clients, and the larger the scale the business would have, according to the information made available by the interviews. That may explain why most of the respondents were regular clients of Sister Ping’s and why a smaller number of the respondents were sporadic users of the service offered by small-time operators.

An examination of the data available can roughly classify qianzhuang into two types: Underground banks operating before 1995 were the first generation of

qianzhuangs while those active

after 1995 may be called the second generation. 14 The reasons for using 1995 as the cut-off point are as follows: First, the respondents’

accounts lack a consensus on when the best-known underground

48 Financing Illegal Migration

bank in Chinatown, which was owned by Chui-ping Cheng, was closed down. Second, all secondary evidence available points to the year 1995 as a possible time for the close-down of this qianzhuang .

Ms. Cheng fled the U.S. in late 1993 after the Golden Venture incident came to light in June 1993, and by the end of 1994 the investigation of U.S. law enforcement agencies closed in on her for her involvement in smuggling (Harder, 2001). It is probably safe to conjecture that her qianzhuang in Chinatown was shut down by the government, or closed by her family around 1995 at the latest. 15 Having a span of four years of operation at the most, the biggest qianzhuang in Chinatown, NYC, was fairly short-lived. Another plausible reason for adopting this time frame is that the operating style of the qianzhuangs the respondents frequented after 1995 appeared to be noticeably different from that of the first generation. Furthermore, the clientele of the second generation of qianzhuang seems to be restricted to a smaller group of “prominent” Fujianese immigrants.

Sister Ping: the best-known underground bank proprietor in Chinatown, NYC

Since no empirical studies on Chinese underground banks exist, little is known about the operators or owners of the illegal financing system. Due to their connections with an immigrant group and their alleged involvement in human smuggling and other illegal activities, Chinese underground banks are easily lumped together with organized crime. The organized crime theory prevailed in scholarly publications and at major government hearings from the 1960s in explaining criminal activities such as prostitution, gambling, loan-sharking, and narcotics trafficking, which were perceived to be controlled by ethnic groups such as those of Italian, Jewish, or Irish descent (Nelli, 1969; President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, 1967). According to the 1967 U.S.

Task Force on Organized Crime, organized crime can be differenti-ated from other crimes in that its main function is to supply illegal goods and services to legitimate consumers (President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, 1967, p. 1).

Schelling further points out that another crucial feature of organized crime is that it exercises a monopoly on the illegal markets as well as protecting/extorting illegal markets (1984, pp. 181–182, 185).

Gambetta

disagrees with Schelling by contending that organized

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 49

crime (which is essentially composed of independent business entrepreneurs active in either illegal or legal market) seeks the private protection that only a mafia can provide.

Another school of scholars challenges the organized crime model with regard to the ability of criminal organizations in monopolizing illegal market as nationwide crime syndicates. Instead, they argue that criminal organizations are primarily illegal enterprises that engage in the supply of illegal goods and services (Smith, 1980; Reuter, 1983 ; Haller, 1990). Smith posits that entrepreneurial activities take place along a continuum that includes both legal and illegal operations (Smith, p. 379). Illicit entrepreneurs operate past the point of legitimacy as a result of a response to a dynamic “task environment” (p. 376) and the characteristics and needs of their customers.

An illustration is that three establishments co-exist on the market for the loan-making industry: commercial banks, pawnbrokers, and loan-sharks, serving the needs of varied types of customer and influenced by different rules or regulations. Haller’s historical analysis (1990) shows that the illegal activities, which were carried out by small independent criminal enterprises, were largely small-scale and short-term and violence was not frequently employed for business enforcement. The empirical evidence generated from the narratives of clients of Chinese underground banks provides solid grounds for identifying some of the features and operational attributes central to the illegal financing system.

Cheng Chui-ping, a.k.a Sister Ping, is a prominent figure in the Fujianese community in the U.S. for her role in the human smuggling trade. Her role in operating a popular underground bank was not widely known outside the Fujianese community until 2005.

There is broad agreement among the respondents that her underground bank had been the largest and the best in Chinatown.

Approximately $40 million in illegal earnings were transferred through her underground bank in NYC back to China when her smuggling business was flourishing (“The mother of all snakeheads,”

2003). Most of the respondents were clients of hers in the early 1990s.

She seized the limelight (though admittedly against her will) when her name appeared in a high-profile human smuggling trial in 2005.

She gained prominence both in the Fujianese community and with American law enforcement agencies for different reasons. In the eyes of the American authorities, she was the “mother of all snakeheads”

50 Financing Illegal Migration

(a colloquial expression for human smugglers in Chinese), masterminding several notorious human smuggling operations, taking illegal immigrants hostage, demanding smuggling fees, and being a fugitive who was brought to justice after six years of investigation, a global man-hunt, and extradition procedures by the U.S. authorities (Hurtado, 2005).

However, she is a legend in the Fujianese community for her benevolent acts toward her fellow Fujianese as well as for her reputation in the human smuggling trade. Leaving her family behind in her hometown, a village in Tingjiang, Fujian, she made her way to Hong Kong and Canada en route to NYC with the assistance of smugglers in 1981. She started up her business from scratch by operating a variety store in Chinatown, and probably began to engage in the smuggling business in the mid-1980s, a time when the enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) and an attendant Amnesty provision set off the first round of immigration frenzy in mainland China (Feuer, 2005; Harder, 2001).

Her smuggling business was said to be in a boom period after President Bush issued an executive order in 1990 allowing Chinese to stay in the U.S. permanently in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown (“Mother of all snakeheads,” 2006). By the early 1990s, she was quite an established businesswoman, having owned real estate, restaurants, and the variety store in Chinatown, as well as apart-ments in Hong Kong and a farm in South Africa (Preston, 2005). She was known among Fujianese as the owner of a local underground bank, or a qianzhuang , operating out of her variety store at 47 East Broadway, right across from the Bank of China. Unquestionably, her business turned out to be such a credible rival to the competition that very few Fujianese would patronize the BOC branch across the street (“Mother of all snakeheads,” 2006).

During court trials in 2005 she denied any involvement with human smuggling rings, particularly the ill-fated 1993 Golden Venture voyage, defending herself as an unlicensed underground bank owner helping fellow Fujianese with wiring money home, or offering loans to those who could not afford smuggling fees (Feuer, 2005). Ironically, the majority of respondents (except a few latecomers arriving in the U.S. after 2000) maintained that she was the best-known human smuggler, with extensive networks on both sides of the Pacific. They did not hesitate to further explain that they

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 51

had heard that the Fujianese underworld of NYC was protecting her underground banking operation, 16 since her business came into full swing at a time when Chinatown descended into a gang-infested, crime-ridden place in the early 1990s. In those days, Chinatown was racked by almost weekly outbursts of robbery, kidnapping, and extortion committed by Fujianese gangsters against Fujianese immigrants.

Murder occasionally occurred as a result of failures to deliver ransoms by the deadline set by the gangs, or infighting within gangs (Faison, 1993; LII, 1994; Kocieniewski, 1995). In an environment filled with menace, one older respondent remarked, “you just couldn’t do no business in Chinatown without protection money.”

Another respondent, Mr. Liao, agreed with him that “everybody in Chinatown knew that she worked hand in glove with Guo, Liang-qi, the leader of the Fuk Ching gang.” 17

Nonetheless, Mr. Lin, the only respondent who admitted that he was brought to the U.S. with her assistance, emphasized that “She was a big-time smuggler with a big heart.”

Another respondent remarked:

Ninety per cent of able-bodied men in her hometown and neighboring towns were smuggled into the U.S. with her help. Were it not for her services, how could we come and earn more money and be better off here?

Other respondents would relate some of stories circulating among Fujianese illegal immigrants, like the following:

She was really responsible and kind toward her customers [Fujianese immigrants smuggled into the U.S.]. If someone did not make it into the U.S., she would return his smuggling fee, and promised that his name would be on the short list for future passage. Once there was a guy who died on the trip. She would send the monthly allowance to his widow and helped pull his only son through school. When the kid grew up and reached 18, she brought him to the U.S. dagong zhuanqian [as a waged laborer].

According to the respondents’ accounts, a surprising finding is that Sister Ping did not seem to be concerned about the risks inherent in disseminating information about her identity and her participation

52 Financing Illegal Migration

in operating illegal financial services. Her clients seemed to be well-informed of the whereabouts of her property in Chinatown, and the fact that her huge wealth accrued from the human smuggling trade was an open secret in the local community. This runs counter to scholars’ expectations, based on the study of illegal markets for gambling and loan-sharking, that product illegality shapes the way an illegal entrepreneur structures the relationship with his or her employee, clients, or others involved in transactions. Normally, entrepreneurs would seek to restrict personal information in order to minimize the risks of detection (Reuter, 1986). So presumably there must be a defensive or protective mechanism at work here in the case of underground bank owners. Since this type of underground bank does not make loans to its clients, the prerequisite is that clients must bring their remittances in cash to an underground bank before a transaction proceeds. It is incumbent on the operators to fulfill their obligations to clients, meaning that it is more likely that the defaulting party is an underground bank owner or operator who is unable to deliver the remittance to the designated recipients, or that the money delivered arrives late or is found short upon arrival. If the protection comes from the Chinese underworld through payoffs made by an underground bank owner, gangsters would never be requested by a defaulting underground bank proprietor to intervene or impose punishment for his or her own failure to meet the agreements involved in the transactions. A plausible explanation for why people with access to critical information do not have the incentive to inform against them must lie somewhere else.

Another surprising finding is that none of the respondents regarded Sister Ping as a criminal, even though she was tried and convicted in an American federal court on three counts of alien smuggling, money laundering, and trafficking in criminal proceeds, and is now serving a 35-year prison term (Preston, 2006). Instead, she was highly regarded in the local Fujianese community as a respected businesswoman because she provided desirable, quality services that were needed by the whole Fujianese community: transporting people across borders to find a job and earn money, and transferring money across borders for illegal migrant workers to go toward debt repayment and support of their families. This favorable attitude is extended to other underground bank operators, but Sister Ping stood out above all of them in their eyes. Her good standing in the

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 53

community earned her a place as a top entrepreneur. Her credentials were established by her “successful” career as a human smuggler, her capital (more likely to be accumulated from the human smuggling trade than from her variety store business in NYC), and her extensive network (which consisted of her relatives and friends recruited for running the branches of her underground bank in major emigrant communities of Fujian, according to the respondents). In conjunc-tion with her remarkably risk-taking spirit, these became assets that allowed her to dabble in another line of business, underground banking, providing quality service to the immigrant community.

They admired her for the entrepreneurial acumen with which she took advantage of a business opportunity to earn easy money by identifying the need of her fellow Fujianese immigrants for fund transfers, and for the goodwill she established in starting up a qianzhuang business in both Fujian and the U.S. and by assuring that all transactions went smoothly so that their needs were satis-factorily met. “She is a really smart businesswoman” is a typical remark by respondents, who believed she did not need to advertise in the newspaper. She reaped a good return on her philanthropic acts toward illegal immigrants because her name was spread fast along with those “good” deeds. As a result, she would be offered more lucrative opportunities in the future to expand her business in the Fujianese community. Indeed, her customers in the human smuggling trade became potential clients of her underground bank, as one of the respondents’ experiences has shown. Moreover, many Fujianese illegals who were not smuggled by her were eventually drawn to her remitting business because of her fame as a capable businesswoman.

Other first-generationunderground banks: Sister Ping’s counterparts

Arguably, Sister Ping’s reputation as a sympathetic, capable smuggler was the most effective advertisement for her underground bank. It was so popular that one respondent said:

It was actually quite easy to find where the place was. If a Fujianese stops another Fujianese he bumps into in the street near the Yidong Center [a local Fujianese bazaar at East Broadway], he will be shown the direction right away.

54 Financing Illegal Migration

The information provided by the respondents indicated that her

“banking” service attracted a large proportion of smuggled Fujianese, as demonstrated by most of the respondents’ testimonies, which confirm that going to Sister Ping’s and sending money home was a common experience among smuggled Fujianese in the years prior to 1995. But that does not mean that other qianzhuangs did not exist in Chinatown.

At least 7 out of the 27 respondents used other qianzhuangs during the period between 1991 and 1994. Two respondents’ experiences with another qianzhuang illustrated their experiences. Through a referral, Mr. Hsiu frequented a local

qianzhuang which was oper-

ated by a distant relative, and he also became a client of another qianzhuang owned by a Fujianese who had migrated from Hong Kong (Respondent) . Mr. Lan’s experience was similar: He was introduced by his friends to a local qianzhuang . At the same time he was still a client of Sister Ping’s. ‘ There were no real big differences between the two. I went to another one just because it was convenient: the store was near to the place where I lived’.

Obviously, it caused him no concern to use a less renowned Fujianese’s

qianzhuang based on the recommendation of a fellow Fujianese.

The entrepreneurs who ran other qianzhuangs were faceless figures, as the interviews were unable to elicit rich detail about their background, and the respondents’ narratives did not link them to human smuggling activities. Some respondents may have felt ill at ease with a researcher making inquiries into highly sensitive issues, and they may have had a concern that too much information released about the proprietors of other underground banks could put them at a greater risk of exposure and arrest. However, according to the respondents, the small-time operators did not differ significantly in business scope, composition of clientele, mode of transactions, and transaction costs from Sister Ping’s qianzhuang . The transactions most likely took place in small, humble-looking stores which sold cell phones or phone cards, or provided international phone services. Usually only one person was seen behind the counter handling the transactions.

Apparently, the reputation of underground bank owners is of particular concern for the clients in choosing which one they should

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 55

go to. In comparison to the qianzhuang owned by Sister Ping, a household name in the Fujianese community, other underground banks had to draw in prospective clients through referrals from a much smaller circle of friends and relatives. Thus their scale of business was considerably smaller. One respondent commented as such: “they are no match for Sister Ping’s qianzhuang . Everybody has heard of her.”

If that is the case, remitting services might be a sideline for some of those qianzhaungs to supplement the income source of their regular business. The flip side of lacking the luster of Sister Ping’s “big name”

was that their operations were less likely to draw the attention of the authorities, making them much safer and possibly securing their existence in the market as long as they were able to keep the business afloat.

Second-generation underground banks

At least six respondents had frequented underground banks from 1995 through 2005. The evidence generated from their experiences suggests that some changes occurred in the operating style of the underground banks in or around 1995. After this, the operators of underground banks behaved more discreetly, as manifested in limited information about their identity and business location being available to their clients. More likely than not the clients knew only their surname, or their source of information did not know the name or purposely withheld the information from them. Sometimes the clients were unsure about the existence of business premises, because the transactions did not take place in the fashion they expected. The banks’ business operations appeared to be more clandestine, elusive, or sporadic. The fee was reduced to around US$17–18 per $2,000

from the rate charged by the first generation of underground banks .

Another surprising fact retrieved from the interviews is that the humble-looking storefronts of underground banks might generate a misleading impression that they could only handle small remittances. However, a respondent’s account suggested that they may have had the capacity to transfer large sums of cash, as the operator of a small qianzhuang told him that they would have no difficulty sending $100,000 back to China in a single transaction.

Most of the clients still relied on information through “word of mouth” among the local Fujianese community when deciding

56 Financing Illegal Migration

whether to use the services offered by the second generation of underground banks. For some other clients, the decision to patronize a local qianzhuang might be a result of chance and circumstance.

One respondent, Mr. Wang, and his friend stumbled on a qianzhuang with a sign stating “Express Remitting Service” while strolling down East Broadway in 2005. The storefront on the bustling street was a place selling cell phones. Mr. Wang decided to enter and take his chance with $2,000 in his pocket. 18 But the sign was gone when he had another chance to drop by the same store. Mr. Wang offered this explanation:

You know, these people running qianzhuangs must be in fear [of police raids]. Whenever they feel the heat from the government’s crackdown, they will close the business and lie low; whenever they feel the government’s grip loosen a little bit, their business will reopen again. In that way, the government is never able to track them down. Last time I was lucky running into an open qianzhuang , because it happened some time during the Spring Festival [Chinese New Year], the peak time for Fujianeses here to wire money home. They gotta open the door and must be crazy happy to see money rolling in.

For Ms. Cao and Mr. Liu, two

qianzhuangs they used (one in

Chinatown, NYC, the other in Philadelphia) gave them the impression that they seemed to have no permanent location. They were told to hand over the money to the deliverymen sent by the qianzhuangs .

However, in most cases the respondents had previously been informed of the reputation of the qianzhuang owners/operators by their friends, and also were assured by their informants about the reliability and credibility of the qianzhuangs . The example of Mr. Feng, the owner of a qianzhuang based in Philadelphia, is a case in point.

That was what people called him, “little Feng.” He is a guy from

[___] town back in Lianjiang. A great many people in Philly knew him, and he enjoyed a very good reputation. People could easily spot him in Chinatown. 19 I heard that someone even deposited $50,000–$60,000 at his place [for remittance]. People just trust this guy. You know what? Not just one or two people, there were a lot of people using his qianzhuang . He said to me, “Hey, don’t

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 57

worry, your family will get your money within two or three days at most. It will all be fixed just by a fax.”

Another respondent who used a popular

qianzhuang in

Philadelphia described the owner, Mr. Li, as a “big player,” who was said to have been arrested by the American authorities around 2002. He had successfully extended his business beyond his hometown and owned several branches in different towns in Fujian.

Underground bank operators like Mr. Feng and Mr. Li may be classified as middle-level entrepreneurs judging by their reputation and standing in the community. It seems that an underground bank owner has to weigh carefully safety concerns and the advertisement effect of reputation . Apparently a good reputation can attract clients, but it might also draw the attention of the authorities, an undesirable consequence. This might constitute another criterion to differentiate small-time underground bank owners from middle-level and top entrepreneurs, which is contingent on the risk levels that they are willing to tolerate.

The similarity between the first- and second-generation underground banks is an extraordinarily high degree of reliability of service. Complaints were never made about the quality of qianzhuangs ’

service by respondents, since none of the transactions involving the respondents’ remittances had gone awry: the respondents’ money never got lost or fell short by one penny upon arrival at home. A rarely exception was the experience of a respondent who arrived in the U.S. in 2004, Mr. Liu’s younger brother, who complained to the clerk of the same qianzhuang Mr. Liu had used that the money still had not arrived at his home in China two weeks after remittance.

The cashier apologized to him, saying that “we will re-send it; your family will get it soon.” That qianzhuang did fulfil its promise, but Mr. Liu’s brother was startled by the incident, and stopped using the same qianzhuang again. On the whole, no disputes of any kind between qianzhuang operators and their clients, much less violent incidents, were reported by respondents.

The respondents’ accounts suggested that few believed that qianzhuang owners/operators grew rich off their hard-earned money. Most respondents maintained that the transactions were

“fair dealings.” Additionally, there was little evidence of any affili-ation between these low-profile underground bank owners or

58 Financing Illegal Migration

operators and the Chinese underworld, unlike in the case of Sister Ping. It is possible that the respondents avoided the subject in the presence of the researcher, considering that these owners were, or are still, safely tending their businesses. Also, substantial evidence is lacking in the research that underground banks still exist in both Philadelphia and NYC, since none of the respondents, who have turned to formal channels for fund transfers, confessed to the continued use of underground banks in either location. But this conclusion could be due to the limitations of the small sample used for the purpose of this research, suggesting an important direction for future inquiry. For example, a larger size of sample may include those well-to-do Fujianese entrepreneurs who still prefer to use qianzhuangs to channel their earnings back to China for legal or illegal investment.

Summary

Prior research on Western mafias and Chinese criminal groups suggests the importance of an understanding of the market dynamics shaping the origin, structure, and operations of crime organizations. The mafia in both Sicily (from the early 1810s) and Russia (from the late 1980s and early1990s) emerged as a response to the state’s failure in protecting market transactions and enforcing property rights during a rapid transition to a market economy. The Italian Mafia rose and took the government’s place by dealing in private protection to meet increased market demand for this valuable commodity in both the underworld and the overworld. Mafias or triads are found to be unlikely to dominate all sectors of the illegal economy, because of either the fragmentation of the market or a lack of the required resources and skills (Varese, 2001 ; Chu and Ngan, 2000 ). Coupled with the operational requirements of criminal activities, the influence of market dynamics is even stronger over an illegal market full of risk and uncertainty like the human smuggling trade. Chinese human smuggling is found to be populated by loose networks of freelance entrepreneurs, who operate in small groups independent of the control of organized crime syndicates like the Chinese triads. This is because the market conditions for human smuggling are utterly unfavorable to a crime organization with a rigid hierarchical structure, or a cartel such as those

Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks 59

found among Mafia families, and the continuity and stability of criminal alliance (Zhang, 2008 , pp. 155–172). A recent study on the role of organized crime in cultivation of illicit drugs (cannabis) and money laundry within the British Vietnamese community provides an illustrative point (Silverstone & Savage, 2010). According to this study, the cannabis cultivation has become a prosperous industry not just because Vietnamese immigrants are particularly skilled at growing cannabis. More importantly, it is a direct response to a growing population of cannabis users on domestic market in Britain. The research also reveals that small interdependent ethnic networks feature the operation of cannabis cultivation, which is based loosely on family connections, rather than large-scale criminal organizations.

The present study suggests that during the period of the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, at the height of the illegal immigration stream from the coastal areas of Fujian Province, a significant proportion of Fujianese illegal migrant workers gained access to underground banks operated by Fujianese immigrants in order to transfer their earnings from illegal employment in the U.S. to their home communities. The available evidence is indicative only of unilateral remittance flows across the border, that is, from the U.S. to the emigrant communities in Fujian Province, mainland China. The demand for the processing of remittances by illegal immigrants was served by both American-Chinese banks and underground banks operated by Fujianese immigrants located in Chinatown, NYC. However, the latter’s confidentiality, efficiency, service reliability, and cultural affinity gave them a competitive edge over the regulated channel, which was in competition for clients’ attention. Fujianese immigrants chose underground banks as a preferable mechanism to transfer earnings home for both illegitimate and legitimate purposes: The remittances were used for smuggling debt repayment and for the improvement of their families’ economic well-being.

The evidence shows that illegal immigrants were able to exercise freedom to make rational choices about the supplier of fund transfer services free of any form of coercion. It seems that the important factor in determining the decisions of illegal immigrants was the reputation of the entrepreneur who was a co-ethnic , based on credible information they possessed about the record of “business” activities he or she engaged in and about the estimated worth of his or her property, or

on the recommendations of trusted fellow Fujianese if such concrete information was absent.

The impression obtained from the respondents is that the proprietors seldom specialized in operating a fund transfer business; instead, underground banking was operated alongside other legal businesses. Generally, the owners or operators of underground banks were considered by the illegal immigrants who used their services as honest entrepreneurs, who provided an indispensable service to individual illegal immigrants, making their own lives in the U.S.

easier as well as improving the lives of their families staying behind.

No evidence suggested that violence was characteristic of the operations of underground banks either in the home communities or in the U.S., nor of the interactions between the owners or operators and their clients. Though some underground banks reportedly had the capacity to handle the transfer of large sums, most of the transactions involving illegal immigrant clients seemed to be small and were carried out by small-time operators who maintained their activities on small scale.

Mechanism, Purposes, and Role

of Underground Banks in the

Smuggling of Chinese

This study illustrates that the entrepreneurs operating underground banks responded to market opportunities arising out of the needs of a specific ethnic group of illegal immigrants. However, the available information leaves other puzzling questions unanswered. Data derived from this research show that underground banking operations rarely extended to customers beyond their co-ethnic group members and generally remained in a clearly defined, geographically circumscribed area – the Fujianese settlements in Chinatown, NYC, and Philadelphia. These attributes of underground banks do not seem compatible with the principle of profit maximization and market expansion. A plausible explanation for this finding is the role of ethnic trust. However, how ethnic trust governs the transactions of underground banks and interactions between operators and their clients is not clear.

Furthermore, this research is also interested in other purposes underground banks may have served in addition to sending home remittances and how their contributions may have affected the lives of emigrant families and their home communities. Finally, because the main clientele is illegal migrant workers smuggled into the U.S., this research asks what role Chinese underground banks may have played in facilitating illegal cross-border

movement.

Central role of dialect-centered networks

Dialect-based networks versus kinship-based relations The lineage, a highly organized kinship organization in agrarian China, was considered to be the most important social unit next to the family. An individual’s membership in a particular lineage ensured his physical safety, the protection of his individual rights and property, and his social status (Potter, 1968, p. 165). A local lineage functioned as a “corporate actor,” which allowed its members to draw on its material and nonmaterial resources (Baker, 1979

;

Freedman, 1958). The lineage managed a variety of local affairs, from running schools and managing ancestral halls, village lands and communal property, to providing loans, organizing militia, leading ritual observations, and administering informal justice (Freedman, 1958; Potter, 1968). Similarly, lineage-based cultural practices could be instrumental for facilitating the operation of underground banks, specifically in terms of pooling clients, setting norms, and settling disputes with clients. The remnants of lineage traditions are still visible in illegal migration, for example, as signified by the disproportionate frequency of several surnames among illegal immigrants, such as Chen, Huang, Lin, and Zheng, suggesting that bearers of those surnames are members of the dominant clans in localities.

According to Peng (2004), kinship-based networks or the bond of lineage assume considerable importance in the success of private business in China’s early reform era. Peng’s study demonstrated the positive effects of kinship networks on the success of Chinese rural industry in the early reform era based on empirical data from 366 Chinese villages. Although they were established “for noneco-nomic purposes, yet with economic consequences” (Coleman, as cited in Peng, 2004), Peng illustrates the important role played by kinship networks in advancing the economic performance of China’s rural private enterprises during the period when formal property laws were not yet in place and market institutions were inadequate.

He argues that kinship relations, as opposed to a conventional sense of network resources , conferred social benefits on private entrepreneurs through three possible mechanisms: the informal enforcement of property rights facilitated by kin solidarity , capitalization made possible through kin trust, and market information and opportunities

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 63

accessible through external bridging ties at the community level (pp. 1068–1069). In particular, kin solidarity and trust act to protect against predatory local cadres, and reduce the uncertainty and high transaction costs arising from poorly- established formal institutions.

Peng’s findings concerning the role of kinship networks were particularly relevant to the exploration of the use of the underground banking system among Fujianese illegal migrant workers, because

zong-zu 1 used to be one of the distinctive and salient features of the social organizations in South China, particularly in Guangdong and Fujian (Sprenkel, as cited in Freedman, 1958).

Watson’s anthropologic study on Chinese laborers in Britain highlights the importance of the role of the lineage system in the migration and settlement process of emigrants sailing from a Cantonese community in Hong Kong in the 1950s (Watson, 1975). Recent studies point to the reemergence of the kinship system that was dismantled during the political movement in mainland China after the reform era in the 1980s (Johnson, 1993; Peng, 2004). This resurgence may now involve an important role for the lineage system in mobilizing financial resources and exercising normative control over the use and operation of the Chinese-controlled informal financial systems prevalent in an ethnic community.

The data derived from this research suggest that the importance of kinship networks may have given way to dialect-specific networks in the context of illegal migration through human smuggling. The Fuzhounese dialect is the language for social communication among Fujianese illegal immigrants in the U.S. This dominant local speech helps distinguish Fuzhounese speakers from two other Fujianese linguistic groups: Putianese speakers, who inhabit the central Fujian coastal areas and the area to the south of the Fuzhou prefecture, and Minnanese-speakers, who occupy the southern regions, historically the main source of overseas migration (Pieke et al., 2004).

Traditionally, the place of family origin ( zuji ), claimed as the territory of a local lineage, occupies a significant place in the construction of identity among overseas Chinese. Primeval as it sounds, particularly for those who have never visited their place of origin and even have no relatives there, the ancestral village signifies the root of the families and a sense of belonging. As such, ancestral origin confers a value that “provide[s] a socially established channel

64 Financing Illegal Migration

for contact between people who otherwise have little in common”

(Christiansen, 2003).

However, under the circumstances facing Fujianese illegal migrant workers in an inhospitable society, the lineage bonds harnessing fellow villagers may not be of much practical importance as a Fuzhounese-dialect-based identity. The limited resources of a single lineage and common concerns compel immigrants to seek emotional and material support beyond lineage ties or native-place links. The linguistic affinity may serve as a more useful vehicle for Fujianese illegals coming from different areas to share in a broader-based identification with other Fujianese than limited numbers of fellow villagers in the process of negotiating the new environment and circumventing the regulations of the host countries. Thus, the meaning of community has changed for overseas Fujianese migrant workers here in the U.S., in that it is no longer restricted to a kinship-based village or town, but has expanded into a wider geographic unity identifiable through the use of the same dialect.

For contemporary generations of Fujianese illegal immigrants, it seems that a new identity has come to take shape based on a regional dialect, migratory experiences linked through human smuggling, and the existence of similar barriers and risks confronting them in the host country. When a Fujianese comes to the U.S. through human smuggling, the old identity imprinted on him by social class is left behind at home. Instead, in the U.S. he is merely a Fuzhounese sharing the same fate with other smuggled Fuzhounese. For instance, a small number of the respondents in this research were well-to-do businessmen before being smuggled into the U.S. Their self-made wealth gave them a sense of superiority over fellow Fujianese who were peasants or fishermen when they were in China. Now, except for the few who have managed to work their way into the ranks of the established entrepreneurs, most of them work in similar menial jobs, sweating for long hours for low pay, and even their goals are the same: to provide for their family by sending remittances home, and then help their families to migrate to the U.S.

An illustration of this change is the self-identification among Fujianese immigrants, who may be cognizant of the benefit which this regional-dialect-based identity confers on them. They claim themselves as “Fuzhounese” whenever asked by a non-Fujianese speaker about their origin, even though they actually came from different

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 65

rural areas under the jurisdiction of Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province. When a Fujianese illegal migrant is probed further by the question, “Which part of Fuzhou did you come from?”, the response is usually, “Why do you want to know about that?” or “What is it to you?”; then he will turn to other topics, or just walk away. That reveals an additional function that the regionally-recognized dialect serves: It can help Fujianese immigrants to differentiate “them” (outsiders) from “us Fuzhounese” immediately, and thus effectively head off an outsider’s prying inquiries, which are perceived as potentially threatening to their safety. In this sense, dialect-based networks function as a self-protection or defense mechanism, mitigating the fear and inse-curity among group members, who consistently feel under threat of the authorities’ intervention while going about profit-making activities within Fuzhounese-speaking communities.

One Fujianese entrepreneur explained why Fuzhounese employers normally would not hire non-Fuzhounese speakers:

To be sure, if you cannot speak Fuzhounese, that will give you a hard time communicating with your boss and other Fujianese co-workers. More important, every business has its own secrets, be it operational, financial, or any other things; we just don’t want outsiders to know about it. Fellow Fujianese are more trustworthy because they are your own people. They don’t speak out against their own.

Another respondent’s testimony also exemplifies the role of the dialect-based identification which motivates Fuzhounese-speaking people to extend help to new arrivals who are unrelated to them. For her, it was “townsfolk,” instead of kinfolk, who mattered most to the survival of illegal immigrants like her in a foreign land.

In those days, there were a lot more Cantonese than Fujianese in Chinatown, Philadelphia. When we [the new immigrants] first landed here, we didn’t have any idea where to find a job and a place to live, and had nobody to turn to. The pressure was unbear-able! But we felt so different when we heard somebody speaking in Fuzhounese in the street! No matter where we came from, Lianjiang, Tingjiang, Changle, they are neighboring towns to each other, and that makes us all fellow townfolk. We speak a

66 Financing Illegal Migration

pretty similar dialect. Yes, we Fuzhounese are uneducated people, but we value renqing [feelings associated with personal relations]

very much. Even if you didn’t know anybody here, as long as you spoke Fuzhounese, people would be willing to help out.

Bounded solidarity

There is a growing tendency in immigration research to emphasize the importance of social capital in shaping economic behavior.

Waldinger (1986) argues that ethnicity is a valuable resource in organizing a labor market and maintaining stable employment relationships in favor of the development of small ethnic businesses.

The bosses of small immigrant firms can use their ethnic networks to recruit an attached labor force primarily consisting of co- ethnics.

Expectations and norms grounded in ethnic commonality are conducive to establishing rules in the immigrant workplace that are acceptable to both management and workers, thereby diminishing potential conflicts in the employment relationship (p. 272).

In its theoretical elaboration of embeddedness or social capital, Portes and Sensenbrenner’s conceptual formulation (1993) attempts to refine the bounded solidarity and enforceable trust through which social structures affect economic action. As sources of social capital, both are grounded in a heightened sense of community shared by immigrant groups and built into community networks. According to Portes and Sensenbrenner’s proposition, bounded solidarity arises among members of an ethnic community when they are confronted by adversarial situations in a specific time and place, such as the discrimination and prejudices experienced by immigrant groups in a host society. It can be accessed by members of this immigration group as a social resource to summon mutual support among group members, thus integrating individuals’ pursuits of self-interest into the search for a public good for the whole group. Bounded solidarity is shown in immigration studies to be of great value in setting up and expanding small migrant enterprises (p. 1329). Viewed as a collective sentiment, bounded solidarity is helpful for reinforcing immigrants’

identity in a hostile environment and developing the capacity to restrain individual members’ behavior due to the moral obligations inherent in it. Portes and Sensenbrenner also noted the variance in bounded solidarity among different ethnic groups, which is believed to be associated with the ability of a specific immigrant group to

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 67

reenact their own cultural values and practices in a receiving country (pp. 1329–1330).

In contrast to bounded solidarity, enforceable trust has “a strong instrumental orientation” (p. 1332). It represents the community’s capacity to monitor and mete out sanctions to the group members. The strength of enforceable trust is directly associated with the resources of the community, i.e. its capacity to dispense rewards. The literature in economic sociology suggests that enforceable trust is indispensable in the operations of the informal credit systems prevalent among ethnic groups (Coleman, 1988; Granovetter, 1985; Hechter, 1987; Light, 1972, all as cited in Portes & Sensenbrenner, 1993).

Empirical studies on immigration have provided support for Portes and Sensenbrenner’s propositions on the functions of bounded solidarity and enforceable trust in economic and social life among immigrant communities in the U.S. (e.g. Bourgeois, 1991; Geertz, 1963; Nee & Nee, 1973, all as cited in Portes & Sensenbrenner, 1993). Portes and Sensenbrenner also noticed the negative effects of these social mechanisms. High-solidarity communities could develop a free-riding problem, could pose constraints on individual members’ actions and expression, and could exert leveling pressures to restrict the upward socioeconomic mobility of successful members (pp. 1338–1344). The theoretical concepts of bounded solidarity and enforceable trust provide a useful framework for exploring whether similar types of social capital and accompanying problems can be identified in a Chinese ethnic community and how they may influence the use and operation of illegal banking enterprise.

The concentration of Fujianese migrant business activities has carved out a Fuzhou Town within Chinatown in NYC, while the Fuzhounese dialect has accentuated the distinctive collective identity attached to this group. My data show that bounded solidarity is not limited to kinship relations, as Peng argued in his expounding of the mechanism central to the early success of China’s rural industry. Kinship ties are entirely based on consanguinity, delim-ited by a narrow geographic boundary, whereas broader-based ties with a potential for tapping community resources are more attuned to the needs of Fujianese illegal immigrants. Regional dialect-based networks furnish a wider segment of overseas Fujianese communities with privileged access to the resources of the community, including

68 Financing Illegal Migration

information on and opportunities for gainful employment, money and human capital, and even protection against undesirable intru-sion, thereby helping to shape the collective identity and reinforce ethnic cohesion.

However, Peng (2004) rightly captures the key differences between Chinese culture and Western culture: “The definition of ‘individual rights’ in the Chinese context is thus guanxi-specific and particular-istic. 2 It is not universal rights, but ego’s obligation to the alter: no tie, no obligation, and no rights” (p. 1050). Essentially, social benefits bestowed by bounded solidarity built on a regional dialect within Fujianese communities implicitly or explicitly entail obligations expected of individual group members: the allegiance and loyalty of members are expected to extend from their families and relatives to the whole community in the pursuit of the common interests, which could be highly valuable when external threats are present.

The present-day threats do not come from racial prejudice and discrimination, as experienced by the first generation of Chinese immigrants who arrived in the late 19th century. Rather, the threats stem from the government’s enhanced enforcement of immigration law, which puts every illegal immigrant at risk of apprehension and deportation. Membership in this ethnic community, marked by the use of the same regional dialect, is intrinsic to shaping the attitudes and behavioral patterns of group members. That may explain why Fujianese immigrants unanimously feel obligated to safeguard the secrets known among their own against prying outsiders, such as those concerning the operation and use of underground banks in Chinatown.

Bounded solidarity built on dialect-based ties also made for the emergence of an ethnic market niche for businesses like underground banks, which specialized in providing services to solve special problems facing illegal immigrants in their settlement process, seizing on business opportunities thus created

. Both

ethnic proprietors and their clients, illegal immigrants, had a keen interest in conducting business in good faith, which greatly benefited both parties: profits reaped for underground bank owners with little investment, and smuggled immigrants’ earnings sent off safely to their families in China. Much as Sister Ping was lauded for promoting the common good of fellow Fuzhounese by launching her human smuggling business when legal avenues for

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 69

international migration were off-limits for lower-class Fujianese such as peasants and fishermen, the underground banking business was praised for being a great convenience to the Fujianese community when a need arose to send money home safely without alerting the authorities. One respondent thus commented, “they

[ qianzhuang owners] did not really make big money out of it; they were just helping us out.”

As a result, the prevailing ethnic solidarity based on dialect-specific networks has a direct bearing on information diffusion, business promotion, transaction modes, and the relationship between underground bank owners or operators and clients. The respondents perceived that the risk of being apprehended by the authorities would be minimized when transactions were limited to Fuzhounese dialect speakers within Fujianese settlements. One respondent even remarked, “Don’t you know it, that Chinatown is our Fujianese turf?” Underground banks did not have to put an advertisement in local Chinese newspapers. Through word of mouth, information about underground banks was circulated widely within the Fujianese communities. As an older respondent recalled:

The news spread fast, among our relatives, friends, and colleagues.

Sometimes you can even overhear strangers chatting about something to do wtih qianzhuangs while sitting in a tea house, or walking in the street [near East Broadway]. Before Sister Ping’s qianzhuang eventually settled at the Rong-sun store, her qianzhuang moved here and there, to different places around, quite frequently. I still remember one of the places I visited, which was next to a wholesale store. And we’d know it in no time whenever the business changed location again.

Along with general information, the owner’s reputation and credibility would be an important part of the tip trading among Fujianese.

Two respondents put it this way:

My relatives and friends all said that Sister Ping’s qianzhuang sends money in a fast and reliable way. Tou-du-ke from Fuzhou [smuggled Fuzhounese] all went there to send money home. They said she ben-shi-da [had lots of pull], making tons of money. She is the best-known smuggler, because she started up the business earlier

70 Financing Illegal Migration

than others. Thanks to her, all able-bodied men in her hometown had been brought to the U.S.

She loaned money to her fellow villagers for a smuggling fee, with low interest or no interest at all. If there was an injury or death on the trip, she would compensate the family for the loss.

She also arranged jobs for them after they arrived to help them pay off the debt. Whenever somebody owed her money but fell behind in payment, asking for an extension of time, she always said, “Okay, that’s fine.” She is a woman with a big heart.

The interviews show that no special security measures were taken on either side of the transactions: underground banks and clients.

While some of the respondents lived in Chinatown, other respondents needed to take public transportation from different corners of NYC, such as Flushing, Long Island, or Brooklyn, or a two-hour bus ride from Philadelphia. Most of them made the trip alone, carrying a large amount of cash ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 on the way to an underground bank located on East Broadway, NYC. They explained that it was hard to find a companion for self-protection because people usually had trouble setting aside a time for traveling together due to different work schedules. No robbery was reported on the trips. The respondents noted no presence of security guards on the business premises of qianzhuangs , which they attributed to alleged connections of qianzhuang owners to the Chinese underworld in Chinatown, NYC, or to the protection money that presumably had been paid to local Fujianese gangs, which constituted a different set of networks.

When it comes to the transaction detail, the respondents observed nothing secretive about the transactions. For example, a respondent described the transactions at Sister Ping’s qianzhuang as follows: It is just like a regular transaction happening at any other store.

Nothing special or unusual. Two or three cashiers are behind the counter; at least one person counts the money by hand, while one keeps records. I don’t think I saw a machine counting cash there.

They don’t speak much except for telling you how long it takes before the money arrives home and where to pick up the money in Fujian. Sometimes people wait in a line, but it moves fast. Every passerby can see what we are doing there .

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 71

All respondents reported a similar scene with regard to the process of transactions at qianzhuangs that they visited, regardless of their size or reputation. The high levels of visibility regarding the transactions of local underground banks would baffle an outsider without sufficient understanding of the meaning and importance of the ethnic solidarity at play in the closely-knit Fujianese community.

In short, Fujianese illegal immigrants liked to use qianzhuangs for sending their money home, because the cash-based transactions at an underground bank were easy and fast in a safe setting. They were not required to show identification nor fill out forms. At the end of a transaction, they would be given a receipt, bearing a client’s name, his or her phone number, the amount remitted, the recipient’s name and address, and the phone number with which to reach his or her family. Some other respondents said that they were assigned a code number in place of a receipt, or were given both. The case with a qianzhuang located in Philadelphia is unusual, because there was no record in writing, not even a receipt; the whole transaction took place orally. Yet the clients’

money still safely arrived at home. But these practices would not be considered odd among Fuajinese, because it is a commonly accepted practice in the Fujianese community that business agreements are made orally yet carry more weight than contracts in writing.

Enforceable trust

Literature on informal remittance systems invariably credit the popularity and efficiency of the institutions to the high levels of trust within ethnic groups, as co-ethnics are intuitively predisposed to trust their own people in deciding with whom to do business (Maimbo & Passas, 2004). As described above, in the transactions at underground banks the business procedures otherwise regarded as necessary for a formal bank, are stripped to the bare essentials, yet the clients were still drawn to the business. This practice defies common sense because normally people would not trust their hard-earned money to a place like a qianzhuang which is not an officially-accredited and financially-guaranteed institution. If anything goes wrong with a transaction, a client of a qianzhuang cannot turn to court systems to seek legal remedy. So the central concern is how trust is employed to establish norms and mediate or settle disputes when they arise.

The argument made by Portes and Sensenbrenner (1993) provides an important explanation. They argue that “trust exists in economic

72 Financing Illegal Migration

transactions precisely because it is enforceable by means that transcend the individuals involved.” (p. 1332). In other words, bounded solidarity may be necessary for facilitating the formation of an ethnic market where purveyors of service and products, clients, labor, and capital would conflate for profit-generating purposes (p. 1329), there must be a mechanism must be in existence to realize this potential. According to Portes and Sensenbrenner, this depends upon the strength of a community’s capacity to administer rewards and to mete out sanctions among group members. Rewards and sanctions administered by a community may have nonmaterial elements, but eventually they carry “very material consequences in the long run” (Portes & Sensenbrenner, 1993, p. 1332).

Backed by this capacity, trust among co-ethnics encourages compliance with the expectations and obligations embedded in community networks, hence promoting “trustworthy and cooperative behaviors”

(Peng, 2004, p. 1052). Where the business relationship between underground bank proprietors and their clientele is concerned, underground banks are expected to fulfill the promise of sending remittances home in a safe and speedy fashion. The personal and business reputation of the proprietors serves as a basis for this expectation.

The respondents often contended that concerns about the reliability of underground banks were irrelevant to their way of thinking.

Ethnic trust underpins their decision-making in seeking the services of underground banks. First of all, the two transactional parties know that they cannot trust those people outside the community who cannot identify with and protect each other’s identity. Second, each member of the Fujianese communities was aware of the serious consequences of failing to fulfill the promises made to clients by the proprietors. The accounts of the respondents also show that they believed they had a solid basis for relying on the trustworthiness of the owners of underground banks. Their judgment was based on their personal and business reputation, and the family ties of underground bank owners. The evidence usually was from what they heard within local Fujianese communities. Some illustrations of this follow: She [Sister Ping] must have amassed a lot of money through her smuggling business. Even if somebody’s money goes missing due to some accident, she should have money to make good a loss. Plus, if something like this happens, bad news would spread fast at home and abroad; how could she do business [among Fuzhounese] again?

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 73

She was really smart, letting everybody know she was running a qianzhuang in Chinatown. Besides, her human smuggling business was well-known among us Fuzhounese. And she also had businesses in other lines, too. Her husband was running a restaurant. We heard she owned lots of property in Chinatown; the whole building [which housed her qianzhuang within a variety store, and a restaurant at No. 47, Broadway] belongs to her. So we didn’t think her business would go broke in a short while, and her qianzhuang should be very reliable.

Even for those respondents who used other, smaller qianzhuangs run by low-profile owners or operators, through referrals from friends or relatives, they would make the same point about ethnic trust:

Xiang-li-xiang-qin [we are all fellow Fuzhounese]; why do we need to worry about this guy cheating us out of money? You think we don’t know where the guy came from, who are his parents and sisters and brothers, and where he lives? It is very easy for us to find out all about him.

Unsophisticated, or, in their word, “simple-minded,” as the respondents were, they were far from gullible. They inquired about the background of the owners of qianzhuangs . It seemed that two things stood in the forefront of their inquiry: whether this owner/operator was a fellow Fuzhounese, and the reputation of his or her qianzhuang : Was it true that many people had frequented his/her qianzhuang , and that remittances always arrived home safely? More importantly, what gave them an assurance of the reliability of the services of an underground bank was that the informal sanctions possessed by the community were forceful enough to deter any proprietors from committing fraud against co-ethnics, as this respondent remarked:

Even though I did not know this guy personally, there was no need for me to suspect that qianzhuangs could cheat me. They wanted to do business among us Fuzhounese, and they wanted their business to stay long in the community, right? How could a one-time swindler survive? Because words travel fast. Everybody would know about him and what he did overnight.

74 Financing Illegal Migration

The monitoring and sanctioning capacity of an ethnic community could be associated with the high degree of insularity of the community, of which the respondents were keenly aware. As one respondent noted,

I believe it is impossible that qianzhuangs ’ business could reach out to people who do not speak Fuzhounese. Think about it: everybody here speaks Fuzhounese, not Cantonese or Mandarin. True, the news spreads around, but only Fuzhounese know. How could the government have gotten wind of Sister Ping’s business were it not for the Golden Venture?

Their distinctive local dialect and the nature of illegal migration have insulated Fujianese communities from other Chinese immigrant communities, which are composed of Taiwanese, Cantonese, Southeast Asian Chinese, or immigrants from other parts of mainland China. The power of a closed community to confer rewards and punishment on its members may be that much stronger (Portes & Sensenbrenner, 1993, pp. 1336–1337) because chances are low that there are economic opportunities to be capitalized on in a safe and secure fashion outside their own community.

The existence of other options for transferring funds may have given Fujianese illegal immigrants the upper hand: They might choose not to patronize a local qianzhuang . It also gave an incentive to the owners of underground banks to observe the norms and expectations “built into the business networks of the enclave”

in order to attract repeat clients (p. 1335). Any breach of this informal understanding or violation of the norms would inflict damage on the reputation of the owners so irreparable that the entrepreneur would face the consequence of being excluded or ostracized from the community business circle. Without the need to resort to coercive measures, this informal sanction may suffice to establish business goodwill among underground bank owners.

This being so, the respondents were highly confident that their trust would not be abused by qianzhuang owners, as described by one respondent:

People just wouldn’t do that, unless someone wants to pull tricks once and run away with other people’s money. I don’t believe that

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 75

he would have the guts to come back [to the community] and do business again.

Indeed, a good reputation was the hallmark of Fujianese-operated underground banks. None of the respondents reported that they had ever heard of a single case in which the families of immigrants were shortchanged by a qianzhuang .

Negative effects of community networks

As noted by Portes and Sensenbrenner, the same social mechanism which convinces individuals of the benefit of utilizing collective social resources within a community could produce negative effects, including free-riding problems, and constraints on an individual member’s freedom and the upward social mobility of successful members (Portes & Sensenbrenner, 1993, pp. 1338–1344).

This research provides an opportunity to explore what form such negative effects might take within the Fujianese community. This research shows that they take on different manifestations in the case of Fujianese communities in the U.S. The evidence available from this research suggests that a community of high solidarity may nurture an environment supportive of norms espousing certain deviant and even criminal behavior. Simply put, a deviant culture is found to be an embedded feature of this ethnic community. Such a culture evolves when self-interested individual economic pursuit is identified with, and is perceived to further an ethnic community’s collective interest. The likelihood is greater that individual members of this community will subscribe to illegitimate responses to the community prescriptions for economic attainment. When in the name of community service the operation of any profit-generating illegal undertaking prevalent in an ethnic group conflicts with the laws and regulations of the host country, the prevailing cultural orientations in the community are generally unfavorable for legal compliance.

This cannot find a better illustration than the collective experiences of Fujianese immigrants, who over two decades have been obsessed with seeking illegal entry into the U.S. with the assistance of human smuggling groups, and are unabashed in setting up unlicensed remitting businesses to send the smuggled workers’

earnings home. In spite of their illegal nature, these activities have

76 Financing Illegal Migration

been reinterpreted by illegal Fujianese immigrants as similar to legal undertakings by entrepreneurs for profit-making, serving the public good of the community as a whole. The treatment of smugglers and underground banking operators as business agents acts as a convenient justification for the endorsement of illegal activities in the community. As all social capital of a closed community is mobilized toward attaining common goals of economic success – for example, the utilization of illegal entry and illegal employment in the U.S. (or other developed countries) as a family strategy to improve family income – another negative effect would be that the entire ethnic community could be beset with perpetuating illegal and criminal activities. During the course of the interviews, none of the respondents expressed misgivings about unauthorized entry into the U.S., aided through human smuggling, or about using the services of underground banks, which was seen as relatively innocuous. As one respondent retorted,

We did not steal or rob. Being smuggled into foreign countries, or using underground banks, it is pretty normal in our community.

Why make a fuss over it?

The comment of another respondent stresses the point made by the above analysis.

Smuggled Fujianeses are all over the world now. We just came here to seek better opportunities, work hard, make more money, and support our families. Smugglers or underground banks, they are just there helping us out.

Illegal immigrants’ use of underground banks

Wage levels of Fujianese illegal immigrants

In order to explicate the purposes of the use of underground banks by illegal immigrants, it is necessary to clarify some important issues.

For example, how much they make on average out of their menial jobs, and how they manage to pay off exorbitant debts while earning below-minimum wages, even with the assistance of an efficient mechanism like underground banks. The following section examines the Chinese enclave economy over the past decades. Fujianese

immigrant workers are overrepresented in the three trades and services dominated by ethnic businesses: restaurants, construction, and the garment industry. The restaurant sector is used as an example, not only because Fujianese immigrants disproportionately work in this industry, but also because it is a testimony to the economic success that Fujianese immigrants have achieved during a short period of time.

When the illegal immigration tidal waves began to sweep the U.S.

from rural areas of Fujian Province in the early 1990s, the Cantonese-dominated Chinatown economy was not able to absorb the large numbers of Fujianese illegal migrants. The infusion of smuggled Fujianese immigrants created enormous pressure on employment, and wage levels dropped until the mid-1990s (Kwong, 1997). As testified to by the comments of the respondents, an unskilled migrant made merely $700–800 or less at a garment workshop or working as a helper at a restaurant kitchen. The American government’s heightened border controls in the wake of the 1993 Golden Venture incident did not seem to effectively curtail the human smuggling trade from Fujian, 3

since subsequent years saw steadily increasing numbers of smuggled Fujianese swamping Chinatown, NYC. The number of illegal Chinese entrants intercepted by The U.S. Coast Guard totaled 2,464 in 1993, 4 but more people were successfully transported into the U.S. since human smuggler groups opted out of trans-Pacific sea routes and resorted to safer routes via Central America and Eastern Europe (Kwong, 1997).

Since 1995, the fierce competition caused by massive illegal immigration has propelled Fujianese immigrants seeking to gain a foothold and survive in the U.S., to venture into the industries with low entry barriers, by starting out in low-end, small-scale restaurant businesses, followed by the sector of construction business which specialized in residential renovation work for families. Over the years, a flourishing Fujianese-owned restaurant sector branched out from the metropolitan urban areas into the suburbs and dispersed into states beyond the Northeastern regions, achieving economies of scale of a sort by exploiting fellow Fujianese who were willing to work long hours with lower-than-minimum pay. It is generally believed that the success of predominately Fujianese-controlled restaurants is largely attribut-able to their reliance on low-cost illegal immigrants and vacancies in business ownership left by well-integrated Cantonese immigrants in an ongoing succession process (Kwong, 1997).

78 Financing Illegal Migration

Over the years, the business development initiated by Fujianese expanded beyond Chinatown, NYC, into different parts of the country, gradually taking over the low-end restaurant business in the big cities and small towns, and competitively serving a wider section of American society. Unlike their fellow Fujianese entrepreneurs settling in Great Britain (see Pieke et al., 2004), the owners of thriving Fujianese-run businesses in the U.S. followed a different path , by not only opening up numerous job opportunities for latecomers, but also increasing wages over the years. According to the respondents, by working long hours seven days a week, a kitchen helper in a Fujianese-operated restaurant can earn an average monthly pay of $1,800, a skilled female worker at a garment workshop can earn $2,500 a month, and a construction worker can make as much as $3,000 a month. Because payment is in off-the-books money, tax is not withheld, and free room and board is usually provided for migrant laborers who work in restaurants, most of the Fujianese migrant worker’s earnings can be put aside for remittances sent back home. Under these circumstances, Fujianese immigrant workers are definitely far from being at the bottom of the wage scale (Pieke et al., 2004; Chin, 1996 ).

Smuggling fees and debts

The purposes for which the respondents sought out the services of underground banks were influenced by the mode of smuggling fee payment and by their need to repay the debt incurred as a result. The general pattern was that payment was due right after the respondents safely arrived in the U.S. Smugglers would demand that the respondents immediately make a phone call instructing their families to pay the smuggling fee in a lump sum to the smugglers in Fujian. The newly-smuggled respondents would be detained by debt collectors working for the smugglers until the payment was made, at which time they would be released from a “safe house.” 5

According to the respondents, they were saddled with smuggling debts from that moment on, with monthly interest ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. However, it was not a problem for them to negotiate a payment plan with the lenders either from the home villages or in the U.S. The loan could come either from their families, relatives, or friends free of interest, or from people who provide loans at varying rates of interest. The respondents did not agree with

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 79

the label “loan sharks” attributed to their lenders by research and media reports. In fact, they noted that many of them were not even professional lenders. Many respondents said the interest rates offered by the lenders were close to those offered by commercial banks. Few respondents characterized these loans as usurious lending. Often the loan was pooled among a variety of people on the tacit understanding that it was given out of consideration for renqing (the social relations arising out of networks). According to the respondents, there were no restrictive or fixed terms between debtors and creditors in either written or oral agreements specifying matters such as payment plans, time limits for repayment, penalties charged for late payment, or collection schedules. In most of the cases there were not even any guarantors.

Practices of this kind were widely accepted among Fujianese immigrants, probably because the creditors were assured that the loans were made with great care based on the credibility, reputation, and social networks of the debtor, and more importantly, based on the prospect of a “well-paying” job waiting in the U.S. The ultimate guarantee was the sense of responsibility and honor grounded in the lineage-based tradition characteristic of Fujianese from rural areas. The levels of trust were so high that some debtors were allowed to “take their time paying debt off.” In this context, qianzhuangs were described as providing needed services for remitting money to discharge smuggling debts and to support families in Fujian, but none of the respondents used qianzhuangs for making smuggling fee payments.

Interviews with the respondents suggested that the majority of them stopped using qianzhuang after they were joined by their families, or after their debts were cleared (and the debt for their spouses if she or he was also smuggled into the U.S.). By the time Sister Ping’s qianzhuang was shut down, most respondents, except for a few from lower-income households, had paid off their smuggling debts, or were at least close to being debt free. The exceptions were five respondents who were able to find other qianzhuangs than Sister Ping’s and thus continued to use them, including two latecomers who arrived in the U.S. after the year 2000.

Life in the U.S.

Those years of organizing their lives around hard work, saving money, and sending money home for debt repayment took a toll on

80 Financing Illegal Migration

the quality of life of the respondents. In the interviews, respondents used the expressions like “pain,” “loneliness,” “huge pressure,” “work all day long,” and “not a human life” to describe their experiences of living and working in the U.S. The majority of the respondents were married men, who had left their wives and children behind at home in rural Fujian, while toiling in restaurants or garment factories to earn money for debt repayment. Respondents had been separated from their families for between 4 and 15 years at the time of the interviews.

Most of the respondents in the sample were restaurant workers.

Unlike Mexican illegal migrant workers, Fujianese immigrants enjoyed considerable mobility within the U.S., probably because the odds of detection and arrest by the American authorities were perceived as low for this group. Nearly all of the male respondents had the experience of working outside of NY State, although this is a situation they tried to avoid. Despite their preference for staying in NYC, respondents would accept a job in the “ waizhou ” (meaning

“out of New York State”) if that was the better option to meet their financial obligations. The market for low-wage jobs in Chinese restaurants is large, with 500 restaurants clustered in Chinatown, NYC, and more than 36,000 scattered across the nation (more than the number of McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s outlets combined) (Luo, 2006; LII, 1995 ). According to one respondent: Actually pay is much higher in W aizhou . Even a kitchen helper could earn as much as $1,600 per month in the early 90s. But a small town in W aizhou is a hell of a boring, lonesome place.

We worked long hours in the restaurant, and were off around 11:00pm. Whenever we had a day off, we had nowhere to go in a small town. In Chinatown, NYC, at least we could browse vendor stalls in the street and buy whatever we can afford ; there, we could do nothing but hole up in the apartment. We don’t know the language, couldn’t watch TV, and there was no Chinese newspaper out there. And even worse, we did not have a cell phone at the time. So nobody wanted to go and work in a waizhou restaurant unless there was no choice.

Even when they worked and lived in a metropolitan city like NYC, feelings of loneliness and helplessness still haunted them.

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 81

One respondent, who currently owns his own take-out restaurant in Philadelphia, recalled his early years in NYC as follows: Life was so hard in the early years! Whenever somebody took it out on me, or I got sick, I’d miss home terribly. I could only weep alone, because I had nobody to turn to. My wife and children have stayed behind for many years. I am a kinda traditional man, and I don’t want to mess around with other women. But I know many marriages fell apart because the wives couldn’t get out [of China], and they had not been together for way too long.

So when my wife said she wanted to be smuggled in here, I didn’t say anything to her, except that you gotta prepare for things bad.

Life is tough here. My wife said she didn’t care as long as we could be together ...

I sent all my money home, except leaving $100 for me to cover monthly expenses. Enough for me because I ate the restaurant’s food and shared a tenement with six to seven guys. I have been in the U.S. for 16 years, but I haven’t been to anywhere for fun beyond NYC and Philadelphia, and have never watched a movie.

All these years I didn’t do anything else than work my butt off zhuanqian yangjia [making money to support my family].

Another respondent said:

In the U.S.

qin-qing [ties binding family members] and

ren-qing

[mutual relations without filial obligations] are more and more flimsy. We work hard for many long hours every day, so we don’t have much time for staying in touch with relatives, friends, or townsfolk, nor have many chances of seeing each other. The best opportunities for get-togethers are at the weddings of our hometown friends, or on Thanksgiving Day, when most Chinese restaurants are closed.

I know two brothers, who were smuggled into the U.S. at different times. One brother lives in Philly, and the other one in NYC. Guess what? The first time they met each other was a couple of years after they came to the U.S., because everybody has been so busy with dagong zhuanqian [working hard tor earn money].

In addition to complaining about the boredom and loneliness resulting from the intensity of their work, many respondents

82 Financing Illegal Migration

grumbled about the deplorable living conditions. In the face of the pressures of debt repayment and supporting families, Fujianese immigrants cut down on their expenses by sharing a flat with fellow Fujianese, since renting in Chinatown was expensive. One respondent said they had to make do with a small room in a base-ment in which six men were crowded together without a kitchen or heating. Many people stayed in tenements occupied by six or seven Fujianese sleeping in bunk beds in a small room. Usually, a highly cramped room like this was turned into an exhibition of “the art of vertical living: bunk beds, wooden lofts, shelves that reach to the ceiling, boards strung across pipes to create storage space,” to quote a journalist’s impression after she interviewed several Fujianese immigrants (Lee, 2003). It was quite common that a family had to settle for a three-bedroom apartment shared with two other families. When a family had to receive a relative who was newly arrived in NYC they had to make a bed in the sitting room before he or she could find a place to live somewhere else.

Impact of remittances sent through underground banks on emigrant families and communities

The respondents’ experiences show that Fujianese illegal immigrants willingly sacrificed for their families who remained behind in rural areas of Fujian. A large proportion of their earnings obtained under harsh conditions was put aside for remittance, which exemplified a sense of responsibility for their families and served as a reliable link connecting the overseas migrants and far-flung home communities. According to the respondents, even though many respondents’

families were situated on the medium income level, the respondents’

spouses stayed at home taking care of children and aging parents according to local custom. Thus, overseas remittances became the sole source of household income for most of the respondents’

families.

For Fujianese immigrants and their families, remittances are expected to be net gains that are derived from the U.S.-bound migration through human smuggling. However, this expectation comes to pass only after their accumulated smuggling debts have been paid off. Consequently, respondents’ narratives suggest that a significant portion of the remittances is initially dispensed for the purpose of smuggling debt repayment. Beyond this purpose, evidence from this

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 83

research indicated that the allocation of remittance income could be divided into three main categories. The first type of expenditure went to observing a community ritual found only in the rural sending regions of smuggled Fujianese.

Prior to departure many would-be migrants would take a vow before the god/goddess which their village worshipped as its protector. After they arrived in the U.S. safely, they would send home their earnings from the first month or two, and their family would invite people to a banquet or offer a sacrifice to the idols for the safe passage of their family members, or hire a dancing and musical troupe for enter-taining the guests, as described by one respondent:

Typically, many migrant families compete for who can put on display the greatest variety of dishes. They certainly don’t want to miss such a grand opportunity for pompous display of their family wealth. If a family throws five thousand Chinese yuan on it, their neighborss’ families could not rest without arranging a sacrifice worth ten-thousand yuan.

Some others who did not believe in the village’s god or goddess still needed to send their savings from their U.S. employment to their families so that they could throw a banquet for relatives and friends in their home village in celebration of their safe arrival. One respondent tried to explain how prevalent this practice was among smuggled Fujianese:

I am sure the majority of smuggled Fujianese did this. As for the number of tables for a banquet, that depends. My family ordered five or six tables [with ten people on each table].

Another respondent acknowledged that this was an occasion for lavish expenditure for some migrant families: 20,000–40,000

Chinese yuan (US$2400–$4800) were spent on arranging 10–30

banqueting tables.

Second, as noted above, it is quite common for the emigrant households to rely on remittance as a main or sole source of household income. Undoubtedly, overseas remittances raised household income and improved the material well-being of migrant families to a varied extent. The changes in the household standards of living

84 Financing Illegal Migration

brought on by the remittances to the respondents’ households were by no means uniform, depending on family income levels6 . All the respondents’ families had already owned a house prior to their departure. The houses were far from “modern” or “comfortable” in a Western sense (for example, there might be no bathroom in a house), but contained basic amenities, such as indoor electricity and a water supply. Thus the bulk of the remaining money was apportioned to family maintenance, or non-subsistence purposes. Those included food, clothing, improvements to housing, electronic goods (color television sets, stereos, washing machines, and refrigerators), gifts for life-cycle rites (weddings and funerals), and school fees for children’s education. For low-income households the remittances “loosen[ed]

the budget constraint on consumption” (Massey & Parrado, 1994).

As one respondent put it,

After I began to send money back, my wife could spend around 300 yuan every month making life more comfortable; before, she could only spare 100 yuan every month to buy food, clothes, and everything.

For a few older respondents who arrived in the U.S. in the early 1990s, when US dollars had a significantly greater purchasing power in rural China, their remittances helped their families achieve a much-desired goal: to build a better and more comfortable house in the home village. However, since a significant number of the respondents’ families were still in debt, they could only afford those household consumer goods which they found of great utility, such as a washing machine and a refrigerator. A worst case was a poor family that had to go further into debt to maintain the daily sustenance of the household. Overall, discussions with the respondents suggested that prior to the mid-1990s the welfare effect of overseas remittances seemed to vary from family to family, and from village to village. For peasant or fisherman’s households on the bottom rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, regular remittance flows through underground banks appeared to make a significant difference in improving the standard of living. For those receiving households on the medium income level, especially those that had previously had a stable income from a reliable job with state sector or a family-owned business, the effect of remittances in improving life quality was modest,

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 85

primarily because the priority in household expenditure was given to debt repayment in the first three to five years upon their family member’s arrival in the U.S.

The third category of expenses was for infrastructure improvement or public works projects at home villages, such as the construction of schools, nursing homes, temples, churches, and ancestor halls, and road construction. These expenditures did not apply to all respondents’ households, but it is noted that with only a few exceptions, respondents confirmed that they felt obliged to voluntarily allocated some portion of their earnings to public projects out of either altruism or a sense of vanity . The practice of soliciting funds from overseas Fujianese migrant workers is common throughout the emigrant areas, but the arrangements vary across different villages.

The expenditures for public projects were evenly distributed across all households in some villages, while at other villages the costs were borne primarily by overseas donors who were former residents.

According to the respondents, it became a common custom in their home communities that the households who were recipients of overseas remittances were expected to contribute more to public projects than other village residents. In emigrant communities, there is a long-standing tradition that the households with remittance income from a family member working overseas enjoy a much valued and much vaunted status as the families of “ hua-qiao ” (overseas Chinese), or “ qiao-shu ” (dependants of overseas Chinese). At the same time, those families are expected to be more generous with their money for both private and public purposes (Pieke et al., 2004). One respondent explained that “your family will lose face if you don’t donate money to the village’s public projects.”

Emigrant families with family members working overseas are expected to donate between US$100 and US$500. The amounts donated were very public and were known to the whole village. In fact, the village committee publicized the donated amounts and the names of donors on a tablet at the entrance to the village or at the ancestral hall. Some respondents also acknowledged that their families had to part with some of their money under a sort of disguised coercion.

If you don’t contribute your portion of the money, you will get into trouble when your family goes to the village officials’ office

86 Financing Illegal Migration

requesting their services on your behalf; for example, an official seal on a notary document.

In summary, the household’s expenditure patterns as reflected by the respondents’ narratives demonstrate that remittances generally ended up being spent on consumption rather than productive investment, such as purchasing agricultural input, or setting up a business that provided goods and services, or any other income-generating activities. Consequently, the additional household income does not seem to have contributed positively to local economic development by creating more job opportunities in the home communities.

In the major emigrant communities in Fujian Province, the centuries-old tradition lives on, men migrating overseas leaving families and a whole community dependent on overseas remittances dutifully sent back home. The labor force from these regions settles and works in the U.S. and other industrialized countries in a clandestine manner, and still earns respect as the pillars of their families as well as home communities in increasing family income and contributing to physical improvements in their home villages. It was through underground banks based in the Chinatowns in NYC and Philadelphia that overseas remittances were safely transferred home, acting as a lifeline for the survival of the families staying behind.

Other formal avenues like banks might serve the same functions; however, the circumstances facing Fujianese immigrants smuggled in the U.S. prior to the mid-1990s influenced their perception that no other mechanisms could be more reliable, efficient, and trustworthy than Fujianese-run qianzhuangs , which were able to tailor their services to the needs of the new generation of Fujianese immigrants.

Shift away from the use of underground banks in

remittance flows

According to the respondents, underground banks have become less active since the mid-1990s. Around that time, international money transfer operators (MTO) like Western Union and MoneyGram stepped up their efforts to expand business among Chinese immigrants. The marketing strategies of the MTOs are particularly noteworthy. As part of the commercial drive to expand their global business, Western Union hired Fujianese agents working in offices

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 87

located at East Broadway, rendering a speedy and reliable remitting service for Fujianese immigrants (DeParle, 2007). 7 While more competitors such as MoneyGram and other Chinese-operated banks have entered the remittance market courting immigrants as clients, they appear to adopt less stringent internal polices and simplified procedures. Fujianese illegal immigrants find themselves facing a more hospitable environment when it comes to remitting money home. In recent years, Western Union has earned wider popularity among Fujianese immigrants, legal and illegal. The shift toward increased convenience in transferring money home back in China through MTOs has been pointed out by the respondents in this research. The following explanation is illustrative of the decision-making of many Fujianese immigrants regarding the shift in remitting behavior toward commercial MTOs.

It is harder and harder to find a reliable qianzhuang nowadays . But we can easily find Western Union’s and MoneyGram’s offices here, on East Broadway. Within the Yidong Center, there are at least three places which can help send money. Plus, now there are not really big differences between qianzhuangs and Western Union.

They [Western Union] even lowered the fee for us Fujianese; you should know, the price was pretty high for sending money home a while ago. Now they still charge a high fee for sending money to other countries. Just for us the fee is a lot cheaper. As long as I keep the remittance below the cap, say, 2,000 or 3,000 bucks each month, they don’t even ask for I.D. So why should I bother to use a qianzhuang ? Using Western Union is much easier, safer than using a qianzhuang , isn’t it?

As noted in Chapter 3 , Fujianese illegal immigrants had easy access to work permits in the early 1990s by going through the process of seeking asylum. These identification documents opened up a legal avenue for them to use the services of local Chinese-operated banks and international MTOs to transmit money back to China for the purpose of paying off the balance of their debt, and for supporting their families back home. For a large section of the undocumented Fujianese immigrant population, the accessibility of the services of MTOs and Chinese-operated banks has meant that the identification requirements are no longer a cause of concern.

88 Financing Illegal Migration

The findings from my study suggest that none of the respondents was still using the services of underground banks at the time of interview. Their decision-making might have been influenced by the changes in the remittance market and the sustained effort at the enforcement of U.S. immigration law in recent years. It appears that underground banks face fierce competition from business rivals concentrated in the financial and nonfinancial formal sector, including banks and MTOs, which have greatly improved the quality of their services in past decades – so much so that underground banks may gradually lose their appeal for their immigrant clientele. It is likely that underground banks are losing ground in the market as the numbers of their clients are shrinking.

Still, some respondents’ accounts suggest that the durability of underground banks is beyond doubt. One advantage of their services possibly remains attractive to a certain type of clientele: Transactions through underground banks do not leave a paper trail. These clients could include established immigrant entrepreneurs, who are looking for unmonitored channels of fund transfer, through which their money will be safely transmitted and invested in mainland China, while evading government scrutiny. In other words, as underground banks shift away from serving ordinary Fujianese immigrants as an all-purpose method for sending money home, they may survive by concentrating on other illegal fund transfer purposes for a narrow clientele. A respondent expressed his views on these people in this way:

Few people now like to deposit their savings here at local banks.

It is because some people do not have legal status. Even if they are legalized, who hasn’t ever tou-shui-lou-shui [evaded taxes] before?

Do you want to give your money to the IRS? It is safer to send money home. Some people lend money for others to open up a store; others give loans to would-be migrants to be smuggled into the U.S. or somewhere else.

For these people, a shell company registered in the Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, or some other offshore tax haven, is probably too

“foreign” an outlet for their money. An underground bank operated by a co-ethnic may provide a more trusted and reliable intermediary to deal with. The anecdotal account provided by one respondent

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 89

offers another example suggesting the continued operation of underground banks.

Qianzhuangs should still be there, but much fewer than before.

Some people get rich from the restaurant business. They want to send money back home for investment, but were scared to even try to do it with a bank, because who else hasn’t done something like tou-shui-lou-shui [tax evasion]? There is a guy from my hometown who has opened restaurants one after the other here, and the business could not be better. Then this guy found a qianzhuang for his money to be sent home. He invested his money in real estate business at home, in Beijing, and Shanghai, making a killing out of it. A while ago his old folk died. Guess how many banquets he threw at the funeral? One hundred! Total cost: 100,000 yuan (US$12,000). Plus, each guest took away with them a red enve-lope containing 500–700 yuan (US$60–84). Why did he throw money away like this? Just to let everyone know that he is made of money! Such news travels fast in our Fuzhounese circle. Nothing can be hidden from us.

However, according to the respondents’ narratives concerning their experiences with using MTOs and banks, the new popularity of formal remitting channels based in Chinatown among illegal immigrants raises the question of whether these money transfer agencies compromise the stringent financial regulations in order to increase their market share among an expanding population of illegal immigrant groups. Fujianese immigrants working and living in NYC or nearby areas have occupied a prominent place among the Chinese clientele of some American-Chinese banks; for instance, 70 percent of Fujianese immigrants used the service of a local bank based in Chinatown (Fang, 2003). According to the respondents, in the mid-1990s identification was not requested at all at some Chinese-operated banks if the amount remitted was less than US$2,000 or US$3,000. Nowadays, one could easily find an agent of an MTO

recruiting new Fujianese clients by promising that the records of transactions will be removed permanently one week after the remittances are sent. A smuggled Fujianese new arrival expressed that he did not have difficulty sending $9,000 at one time at a discounted fee only with a Chinese passport since the agent of an MTO located

90 Financing Illegal Migration

in Chinatown was a friend of a relative. A bank in a similar situation would ask the client to present a social security card or other proper identification document when a cash remittance exceeds $3,000 for one transaction per day. These “flexible” strategies effectively solve the problems with fund transfers for Fujianese illegal immigrants who live in fear of exposure of their illegal identity when dealing with financial institutions. If these respondents’ narratives are suggestive of a pattern instead of individual deviant cases , these formal fund transfer channels seem to step into the role that underground banks used to play.

Role of underground banks in illegal migration aided through human smuggling

Research on illegal immigration reveals that transnational clandestine migration is generated by a combination of restrictive immigration policies 8 and increasing migration pressures (V ä yrynen, 2005 , p. 165). 9 As far as illegal Chinese immigration is concerned, several factors feature prominently in encouraging and sustaining the massive influx of Chinese illegal immigrants: (1) pull factors, which primarily refer to wage differentials between the sending country and destination country and job opportunities in the destination country; (2) push factors, which include deteriorated economic conditions, population growth, and political unrest in China; and (3) mechanisms supporting illegal migratory flow, which include established migration networks in the receiving country and smuggling networks (Chin, 1999, pp. 13–27).

Among those supporting mechanisms, underground banks may serve as a crucial institution in the initiation and expansion of unauthorized cross-border movement of Chinese in several ways. One of the roles is to function as an indispensable vehicle for smugglers to deposit, transfer, distribute, and launder criminal proceeds from the human smuggling trade, which obviously goes beyond the scope of inquiry of this study due to the limitations of the data drawing on clients’ perspectives. Furthermore, because that illegal immigration involves a series of decisions on the part of individual immigrants, an inquiry could be made into whether or not the operation of the systems has any bearing on the decision-making process of Fujianese illegal immigrants, for example, whether they should emigrate to the

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 91

U.S. through human smuggling. Another concern is whether, relative to other remitting methods, the disposition of remittances channeled through underground banks directly or indirectly encourages or facilitates Chinese illegal migration.

As Kwong (1997) points out, Chinese illegal migration is essentially a labor issue. Fujianese illegals take great risks and endure separation from their families to seek gainful employment in the U.S. to improve the livelihood of their families back in China. Arguably, this objective will be frustrated without a reliable financial intermediary to aid those illegal immigrants in safely moving their money back to China.

Surprisingly enough, in contrast to the emphasis placed on ethnic networks in illegal migration, Fujianese illegal immigrants had never given much thought before leaving China to how they should send their money back home given their lack of legal status. In response to the question, “What were your primary concerns before you left for the U.S.?” none of the respondents mentioned that a means of money transfer represented a serious concern for them. The respondents landing in the U.S. before 1995 reported being more worried about a variety of other factors than those arriving later. Those pre-1995

respondents would be worried about whether they could safely find their way to the next destination as arranged by smugglers, whether they could make enough money to clear their debt, or when their family would reunite and live together under the same roof again.

Even this group of respondents appeared not to give much consideration to whether their illegal status would give them trouble when it came to safely repatriating their earnings in the U.S.

Most of the respondents claimed that they had never heard of underground banks operating in Chinatown, NYC, before they headed for the U.S. Mr. Song was one of a few exceptions; he said,

“I heard of Sister Ping’s qianzhuang in the U.S. while I was at home, because one of her relatives opened a branch in a nearby town.”

The respondents seemed to believe that everything would be fine as long as they arrived safely in the U.S. As such, for them the major concern was safe entry into the U.S., which relied on the networks, experiences, and “expertise” of smugglers. Other considerations, such as where to find a reliable way of transferring their earnings, were relatively trivial in comparison with concerns such as how to obtain a loan to cover the smuggling fee, how to connect to overseas ethnic networks and smuggling groups, offered more

92 Financing Illegal Migration

challenges and obstacles to overcome the barriers in international illegal migration .

While this lack of concern for fund transfer channels may baffle a non-Fujianese observer, it comes as no surprise to Fujianese illegals when weighing the decision to be smuggled into the U.S., as suggested by one respondent:

We knew money from America had been tumbling in all the time, to those families who sent their men away through tou-du [human smuggling]. A fact everyone at the village can see. It just had never occurred to me that I should give a thought to how their money made it all the way from America to here.

Another respondent related his observation as follows: The whole village was spreading the news, Mr. So and So’s family sent their son to America, making big money there. Just take a look at how well their house was furnished, the fancy electronic goods they bought, and how much better the whole family dressed. Gee, they were not bragging or anything. That was for real!

Sometimes the emigrant families would simply show US banknotes to the visitors, so that would-be Fujianese illegal migrants were aware that a steady inflow of remittances from the U.S. was behind all these conspicuous changes. Less visible were the channels that enabled remittances to come through, although some people had heard of something like a local branch of a qianzhuang . It is understandable that the avenue for transmitting money was of no particular importance in their overall decision-making process, due to its paradoxical attributes: low visibility and high reliability in those sending communities. Emigrants left China secure in the knowledge that a method for transferring money home should not pose a major issue since they had already heard from reliable sources and seen for themselves that other migrants’ money had flowed back home from the U.S.

While it is one question to attempt to determine how important money transfer from the U.S. was to Fujianese planning to emigrate illegally, it is still another issue to try to asess whether the money transfer method actually worked hand in hand with smuggling operations in enlarging illegal emigration via human smuggling.

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 93

The impact of remittances sent home might serve as one source of evidence of a close connection. The literature on migration and remittances offers an important insight into this issue. The effects of remittances on development are a subject of ongoing debate. However, scholars generally agree that a reliable indicator should include the development potential which remittances generate and the influence of the disbursement of remittances on income growth, inequality, and poverty alleviation (Massey & Parrado, 1994; Rubenstein, 1992; Russell, 1992; Taylor, 1999). The conflicting evidence from empirical studies is used to support two different views on the consequences of migration and remittances. The positive perspective, described as the “developmentalist” extreme, argues that:

(1) migration decisions are part of family strategies to raise income, obtain funds to invest in new activities, and insure against income and production risks; (2) remittances, or in some cases simply the potential for remittances, consequently set in motion a development dynamic by loosening production and investment constraints faced by households in poor developing country environments. (Taylor, 1999, p. 64)

The opposite view, known as the “migrant syndrome” (Reichert, 1982), maintains that:

lucrative migration activities drain migrant sending areas of their labor and capital, crowding out local production of tradable goods

[...]. Over time, villages, regions, and in a few cases even countries, come to specialize in migration, serving as nurseries and nursing homes for their largely migrant workforces. (As quoted in Taylor, 1999, p. 64)

In spite of the limitations imposed by a small, non-probability sample, the findings still offer a glimpse into the profound influences remittances have on local communities. First, the household’s expenditure patterns demonstrate that remittances generally end up being spent on consumption rather than productive investment, such as purchasing agricultural input or setting up a business that provides goods and services, or any other income-generating activities. 10 If remittances indeed were spent on consumption, it is unlikely

94 Financing Illegal Migration

that the inflow of remittances could do much to stimulate production activities and create more job opportunities in local areas. Surely the decisions of migrant families about the use of remittances were constrained by debt repayment, but the pattern of consumption-oriented spending with overseas remittances seemed to persist even after debts were finally served.

The respondents also reported that their families no longer undertake farming or fishing as ways of making a living; they have come to rely exclusively on the regular inflow of migradollars in most cases. Instead, some emigrant families rented out their small land parcels to those migrant laborers coming from poorer adjacent areas and other inland regions beyond Fujian, so as not to incur penalties by the local government for fallowing agricultural lands (Thun Ø & Pieke, 2005). Those outsiders later on had begun to take over local businesses, including restaurants, retail outlets, and grocery stores in the areas vacated by heavy emigration.

Overseas remittances also gave migrant households access to additional income so that they were more likely to able to afford desirable electronic household goods than families without an overseas source, thus producing a notable income differential in the communities, which fosters a sense of relative deprivation among non-migrant households (see Massey & Parrado, 1994; Stark & Taylor, 1991). Scholars argue that this could generate pressures for relatively deprived non-migrant households to engage in international migration, suggesting that the skewed village income distribution from foreign remittances functioned as “a mechanism of cumulative causa-tion” to turn migration into a “self-perpetuating” process (Massey & Parrado, 1994). The result in Fujian emigrant regions, at least, was further international migration through human smuggling.

One respondent admitted that:

in those early years everybody was poor, and desperately looking for ways to make a fortune. But not many people in my village were smuggled into America in the early 1990s. We kinda made a move ahead of other folks. Then I found a job here and began to send money back home through a qianzhuang . Our neighbors were all jealous. They said, “No wonder they have money constantly coming in: the family has sent three men to America! We can do that, too!”

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 95

According to respondents, such a reaction was quite common among those community households that did not participate in emigration aided through smuggling in the early 1990s. The inflow of remittances did not seem to encourage investment in productive enterprises. Instead, it acted as a stimulus for illegal emigration from the sending areas. These findings also echo the results of a study on remittances sent by Fujianese illegal immigrants settling in Europe (Pieke et al., 2004). Those towns or villages across emigrant regions in Fujian witnessed steady growth in illegal U.S.-bound migration: Below 50 percent of the whole community population, particularly males, in the early 1990s, it surged to 80–90 percent ten years later, based on the respondents’ observations.

The current situation of major emigrant communities as described by the respondents is strikingly similar: the able-bodied men between 18 and 50 years old have nearly all migrated to the U.S. or other industrialized countries with the assistance of human smuggling groups, leaving elderly people, women, and children

“safeguarding” Western-style new houses built with migradollars standing in rice paddies. Younger children, who were born in the U.S., were sent back to the care of grandparents because Fujianese migrant workers did not have time to take care of their own children due to their demanding work schedule in the U.S. Owing to the loss of the populations of adult males, some communities are referred to as “ghost towns” or “widow villages” (Liu, 2007; Rosenthal, 2000). Women in most of the cases would eventually follow in the footsteps of the men, either by seeking the service of snakeheads to be smuggled into the U.S. or other Western countries, or by uniting with their husbands after years of waiting as required by legal migration procedures.

This scenario, characteristic of the emigrant communities in Fujian, resembles the “migrant syndrome,” which mirrors the pessi-mistic views of the academic debate on the developmental impact of remittances on local communities. In considering these findings, the reader should first be cautioned against accepting an overly negative view of the role of underground banks in channeling back home external capital derived from illegal migrants’ earnings in the U.S., with the unanticipated result that the sending economy becomes stagnant and ends up constituting an impetus to more illegal migration. Although these developments are mentioned directly or

96 Financing Illegal Migration

indirectly by the respondents, the exploratory nature of the research does not permit a definitive answer.

Second, great care is required in assessing whether underground banks have played a direct causal role in Chinese human smuggling based on the evidence produced by the current research. The respondents’ accounts show that the operation of underground banks seems not to carry much significance in their decision to be smuggled into the U.S. However, underground banks did wield greater influence in their decision to choose the illegal money transfer channel rather than other legal institutions due to underground banks’ unique ability to fill service gaps. The evolution of underground banks active in the U.S. suggests that they thrived on the massive inflow of smuggled Fujianese migrant workers in the U.S. and their decline came along with the waning migratory stream of the same illegal population group . Admittedly, human smuggling is a very complex process where a myriad of factors come into play. The evidence based on the experiences of the clients of underground banks only suggests that the role of Chinese underground banks was more pronounced in a particular period in the recent history of Chinese human smuggling starting from the late 1980s. By exclusively taking smuggled Fujianese immigrants as their main clientele, they certainly became a part of the human smuggling process, but they seemed to serve as no more than “facilitators,” just like human smugglers , who are viewed as “migration brokers” by some scholars (Pieke et al., 2004).

Until the other side of story is made available by human smugglers and the proprietors of underground banks, the link between these informal fund transfer systems and the human smuggling trade is indirect at best.

Summary

The respondents’ narratives suggest that the operation of underground banks appeared to expedite the completion of an illegal migration process in the form of discharging smuggling debt, contributing to household income, and possibly financing further illegal or legal migration for family members (see Figure 4.1 ). 11 This highly reliable and efficient fund transfer mechanism served such a critical function that it helped the early generation of Fujianese illegal immigrants, smuggled into the U.S. prior to the mid-1990s,

Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese 97

to clear their smuggling debt at a faster pace within a shorter period than other options would have permitted. A delay in debt repayment may not have had devastating consequences for many Fujianese illegals who took out smuggling loans at low interest rates. However, most of the respondents and their families viewed it as a dragging pain to be burdened with accumulating debt resulting from delay in repayment. Therefore, the operation of underground banks both in the U.S. and in China made it possible for them to achieve net gains of illegal migration, including the increase of household income, relatively greater access to socio-economic mobility, family reunification in the U.S., education opportunities (for their children), medical care, and social benefits in a process of status transition from illegal to legal residency, as many respondents experienced. One respondent’s comment illustrated this point: “ had there been no qianzhuangs in those days, I guess we just could have got stuck here working for more years paying off debts, and our sufferings could have lasted longer.”

The operation of underground banks is found in my study to help pave the way for earlier arrivals (smuggled into the U.S. prior to 1995) to settle in the U.S. and form a population of “seed”

migrants for subsequent “chain” migration. These effects might have increased the propensity of other households staying behind in the home communities to join the international migratory flow in order to generate desired household income. In this sense, given that the principal method of international migration in the emigrant regions of Fujian has been the use of human smuggling, underground banks may have indirectly facilitated illegal migration and human smuggling to a significant extent.

However, the operation of most underground banks seems to have greatly diminished today as a result of government crackdown and strong competition from formal remitting institutions, including Chinese-operated banks, Western Union, and MoneyGram.

Consequently, the prevalence and importance of underground banks have considerably declined for the general population of smuggled Fujianese migrant workers. A related important finding of this study is that a shift has already been completed among Fujianese illegal immigrants away from the use of unmonitored informal channels toward the use of formal sector channels for repatriating their earnings.

to serve the same function as underground banks as a mechanism facilitating the completion of the illegal migration cycle by relaxing financial regulations, in order to expand their market share among illegal immigrants.

Furthermore, the consequences of remittances channeled through underground banks for illegal immigration are reflected in their impact on local development. The additional household income has not seemed to contribute positively to local economic development by increasing investment and creating more job opportunities, for example. Instead, the lack of gainful employment opportunities in emigrant-sending communities, in combination with other adverse effects of remittances – increased income inequality and a heightened sense of relative deprivation among non-emigrant households –

might play a role in encouraging further illegal migration. At the same time, the shift in use by illegal immigrants residing in the U.S.

away from underground banks toward formal financial institutions (banks and MTOs) may result in a change in the range of services provided by the underground banks which stay in business: they are able to offer financial services to those with more serious illegal activities in mind, who wish no proper record of their transactions or no limits on the amounts they can remit.

Facilitating Role of Underground

Banks: Implications of the

Research

This study is the first to investigate the use of underground banking systems among members of a specific ethnic group by tapping the clients’ perspectives. None of the previous research on illegal immigration and human smuggling has addressed the financial component of the process, or the operation of underground banking systems. Specifically, no prior research has elicited firsthand information from the operators or users of underground banks due to the highly secretive nature of their illegal activity. Limitations of data notwithstanding, the narratives of the respondents have provided valuable information regarding the role of these informal fund transfer systems in the lives of their clients, information which implies possible connections to illegal migration through human smuggling. Most of what has been reported herein is unique information never before reported. The following is a brief summary of the key findings of this research.

Key findings

Several important findings arise from this study which merit greater attention. The findings point to the notable changes in the mechanism underlying the existence and operation of informal financial systems, the role of underground banks in the lives of illegal immigrants and their families in China, and the composition of their clientele. These findings raise significant considerations for policy-making.

99

100 Financing Illegal Migration The change of mechanism sustaining the operation of underground banks

A long-standing body of anthropology studies on South China indicates the vital importance of a kinship-based network, or lineage, in the administration of local society and the organization of overseas immigration (See Baker, 1968 ; Freedman, 1958; Potter, 1968; Watson, 1975). This traditional lineage system was also found to facilitate the smooth operation of family-owned remittance businesses in the early 20th century (Woon, 1984) and the revival of private enterprises in the years of China’s economic reform beginning the late 20th century (Peng, 2004). The findings of the present research show that as opposed to lineage-based networks, networks based on regional dialect allowed Fujianese illegal immigrants, as well as underground bank proprietors, to take advantage of the social capital inherent in the expatriate Fujianese ethnic community established in the host country. The high levels of trust between underground bank proprietors and their clientele can be understood as resulting from ethnic solidarity and enforceable trust, two essential components of social capital. Ethnic solidarity built on dialect-specific networks gave Fujianese illegal immigrants a collective identity and served as a well-functioning protective mechanism in screening outsiders and guarding against government penetration.

The role of ethnicity accounts for why the clientele of underground banks were primarily Fuzhounese-speaking immigrants and why their area of operation was confined to “Fuzhou Town,” a distinct Fujianese-dominated commercial district in Chinatown, NYC. At the same time, ethnic solidarity enabled enforceable trust to play a critical part in ensuring the high quality of the services delivered and minimized disputes due to its capacity to establish norms and invoke sanctions on underground bank proprietors within a closed ethnic community. These features may explain why violence was apparently little used in dispute settlement, as disputes seemed effectively forestalled and were thus rarely reported by the respondents. These features are also troublesome at the community level because the research findings illustrate that a community of high ethnic solidarity like that of Fujianese espouses a deviant culture or norms that encourage widely accepted illegal practices.

Change in the role of Chinese underground banks in the lives of illegal immigrants

Respondents’ accounts also suggest that the prosperity of underground banks did not last long. In the early 1990s, the peak time of Chinese illegal immigration, they appeared to play an essential part in facilitating the smuggling of undocumented Chinese labor migrants by servicing the special needs of illegal immigrants as a reliable fund transfer mechanism in aiding the completion of a process of illegal migration. The efficiency and speediness of fund transfer through the underground banking system made for expedited repayment of smuggling debts. The result seems to have been the smoother settlement of illegal immigrants in the U.S., and a spur to “chain” migration for their family members and relatives into the U.S. through both human smuggling and legal migration routes. The early generations of Fujianese illegal immigrants, arriving prior to the mid-1990s, functioned largely as the “seed”

migrants of the ethnic community in the U.S., significantly transforming the composition of the Chinese community and shaping the political and economic landscape of the Chinatown area in NYC in subsequent years.

Put differently, the prominence of underground banks in illegal immigrants’ lives declined in response to changing market conditions and crackdowns by the U.S. government. Since the mid-1990s, more active players, including Chinese-operated banks and money transfer operators (MTOs), have joined in the competition for Chinese illegal immigrant clients, attracted by the profitability of the remittance market. Arguably, some of those legitimate institutions adopted questionable marketing strategies to expand their clientele among Chinese illegal immigrants. Narrative data indicate that more recent arrivals among illegal immigrants tend to use these legitimate institutions rather than underground banks.

As a result, the presence of MTOs avails the new generation of smuggled immigrants of a safe, cheap, and convenient avenue for sending remittances home. It appears that formal fund transfer institutions such as MTOs have begun to fill in the vacancy left by underground banks in serving the need for new generations of illegal immigrants.

102 Financing Illegal Migration Change in the composition of the main clientele

Not only has the use of underground banks changed among illegal immigrants, but also this shift in use toward legitimate institutions may have forced underground banks into a narrower and more illicit function in which funds need to be transferred for illegal purposes.

The number of underground banks in Chinatown has significantly fallen, and those that remain specialize in serving a much smaller clientele for the purposes of tax evasion and other illicit activities. Two plausible reasons account for this change: One concerns strong competition from those legitimate business rivals, including Chinese-operated American banks and MTOs, while the other is the fear of the U.S. government’s crackdowns, which primarily aim at curtailing unauthorized immigration. The government intervention in the U.S. has never targeted informal fund transfer services; however, the intensified enforcement of immigration policies since the occurrence of the “Golden Venture” incident appears to generate a deterrent effect for the operation of underground banking for migrant remittances.

This finding does not bode well for the standing of the surviving underground banks in the community and their continuing role, which is more surreptitious than in recent years. The changing configuration of the remittance market may result in bifurcating their potential clients: One group can be termed “ordinary” clients, whereas the other group can be classified as “prominent” clients.

Those who have been attracted to use the service provided by MTOs include lower- income migrant workers, mostly the younger generation of more recently-arrived illegal immigrants, and settled, legalized immigrants. Some respondents’ statements hinted at the commonality among Fujianese business proprietors of “cheating on tax payment,” or tax evasion, and the investment pattern of some affluent Fujianese immigrants. The implication is that the current main clientele of underground banks could be restricted to the “ prominent”

clients, a fortunate group who likely are established entrepreneurs with more incentive to use the services of underground banks. The specialized use of underground banks will probably continue well into the 21st century as a reliable conduit for concealing the source of illegitimate income and channeling capital back home for an array of purposes, including but not limited to financing smuggling, speculating in real estate, and much shadier dealings.

Practical implications

Because the underground banking system in this study is situated in the context of illegal immigration aided through human smuggling, the relationship between these informal financial systems and criminal activities involved in trading in human cargo on a global scale cannot be minimized. Human smuggling (including human trafficking in a broad sense) is considered among the most profitable and yet low-risk criminal activities, particularly as compared with drug trafficking (Kyle & Koslowski, 2001). The sophisticated and complex cross-border cooperation involving human smuggling immediately raises the specter of “organized crime”. It has become a popular belief that human smuggling is a significant income source for international criminal organizations (McAllister, 2000, as cited in Aronowitz, 2001). Faced with a common problem of data collection, prior studies on human smuggling and trafficking relied on statistical data from official sources relating to illegal immigration in Western Europe, and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) (Salt, 2000), though qualitative empirical data derived directly from smuggled immigrants can be found primarily in research studies on Chinese human smuggling (Chin, 1999; Kwong, 1997).

Much of the prior research focuses exclusively on the organiza-tional structure of smuggling and delineates the modus operandi of organized criminal groups. Even though illegal immigration studies have examined a variety of themes characteristic of the smuggling process – documenting the attributes of smugglers (and traffickers) and the smuggled (and the trafficked), and policy implications – research on fund transfer is notably absent. The lack of research studies on this subject is in large part due to difficulties in collecting empirical evidence of these highly secretive activities.

Consequently, this research not only fills a gap in the knowledge on the informal financial mechanisms used by illegal immigrants, but also contributes significantly to the ongoing debate on the relationship between human smuggling activities and organized crime, as well as contributing to theoretical development concerning the nature of illegal enterprise. This research has particular relevance at a time when transnational human smuggling and trafficking is a growing phenomenon around the globe (Kyle & Koslowski, 2001).

104 Financing Illegal Migration This research has implications for the utility of illegal enterprise theory in explaining the underground banking enterprise. The perspectives of clients, as an important indicator of the market environment in this theoretical framework, present a helpful analysis of the evolving history of this informal and illicit financial system, and of the position of the system in a broad context of illegal immigration through human smuggling. By looking at Chinese underground banks as illegal enterprises, instead of a component of organized crime, this research sheds light upon the demand side of the market, which was shaped by the special needs and focal concerns of their clientele, primarily Fujianese illegal immigrant laborers. This market demand for illegal financial services waxed and waned over the years with different groups of clientele. Another contribution of this research is the insights offered over a period of time. Instead of being limited to one-time, discrete period data, respondents’ reports describe illegal immigrants’ behavioral patterns in transferring funds over a span of at least one decade. As such, these accounts permit inferences relating to the evolution of Chinese-operated underground banks in the U.S. over a longer period.

The in-depth interviews offered a unique opportunity to examine the context and circumstances shaping the decision-making of individual illegal immigrants, and the meaning and impact of the existence and operation of the underground banking systems for their personal lives. Furthermore, the interviews permitted an understanding of their perceptions of underground banks and the impact produced by funds channeled through the underground systems on their families in home communities. Without the input of this hard-to-reach population, the clients of illegal enterprises, it would be much more difficult to develop a comprehensive understanding of how a process of illegal labor migration through human smuggling is built up. This process is translated into a pattern of illegal entry, illegal employment, expatriating earnings for debt repayment and contributing to family and community income, and then further migration through human smuggling or sometimes by legal means.

Illegal enterprise in the market of transnational Chinese illegal labor migration: a multi-network model

The illegal enterprise theory offers a useful perspective for understanding the operation of underground banking and for examining

Facilitating Role of Underground Banks 105

the process of international labor migration through human smuggling. By emphasizing a remittance market arising out of the needs of illegal immigrants and the operating mechanisms of underground banks, the illegal enterprise perspective underscores the importance of exploring further the formation of sophisticated networks and their symbiotic interconnection in the initiation and perpetuation of illegal international labor migration. 1 A multi-network model is proposed here in an attempt to explore the interaction of different networks in human smuggling.

Since the demands of illegal immigrants create varied market niches serviced by different institutions and agents in the migration and settlement process, this analytic framework identifies one critical intermediary mechanism, providing a lens to explore the dynamics underlying the perpetuation of illegal migration. Hence, this framework allows an analysis of the nature of this intermediary mechanism, i.e. agents for cross-border fund transfer, its interactions with other institutions active in the market, and its function in the illegal migration process.

As demand for cheap labor in developed countries draws a large influx of illegal immigrants from developing countries, a market filled with illegal business opportunities has come into being. The illicit nature of transnational migration has given rise to a multi-plicity of demands among illegal migrant workers in attempting to overcome barriers to the financing of their passage, seeking illegal entry, searching for gainful employment, and transmitting earnings for debt repayment and increasing family income, while circumventing detection by the authorities. These demands provide ample potential for profits to illegal service providers. In the context of Chinese illegal labor migration through human smuggling, this model proposes that illegal enterprises are integrally involved in illegal and criminal activities, which are dominated by three networks, consisting of human smuggling groups, ethnic communities both at home and in the host country, and underground banks or informal fund transfer systems (Kwong, 1997; Zhang & Chin, 2003).

Human smuggling groups organize the transportation of migrant workers across vast distances and facilitate illegal entry, while underground banks offer illegal migrant workers a safe and reliable avenue for funneling earnings home. In addition to providing financing for clandestine passage, jobs, and housing for illegal immigrants, ethnic

106 Financing Illegal Migration communities, which are characterized by solidarity and high levels of trust in a culturally insulated milieu, seem to function as an important locus of the growth of such businesses and the dealings between illegal entrepreneurs and undocumented migrants. As such, ethnic communities play a role in cultivating, harboring, and protecting illegal activities associated with the other two networks. This role is shaped by economic interests brought in by human smuggling trade, fund transfer business, as well as ethnic ties.

One important contribution made by the current research is that the multi-network model of illegal labor migration has a potential to advance enterprise perspectives through providing a better appreciation of the dynamics of illegal transnational labor migration in the context of Chinese human smuggling (see Figure 5.1 ).

The model benefits from the conceptualization proposed by two researchers who specialize in studies of smuggling and trafficking in human beings in and across the European Union, in which mainly criminal networks are seen to engage in highly-specialized, well-coordinated tasks in order to assure the success of smuggling operations and reduce exposure to and detection by authorities (Aronowitz, 2001; Salt & Stein, 1997) One research also noticed connections between the illegal markets for smuggling and trafficking and other legal or illegal markets such as those involving domestic service and prostitution (Aronowitz, 2001). However, probably due to the limitations of the data sources (i.e. Interpol reports), neither of these two research studies was able to conclude that actors in this market might constitute other collective entities, illegal or legal, apart from human smuggling or trafficking groups.

In this sense, the present research holds promise for developing a unifying theoretical framework to expound on the complex and sophisticated nature of the transnational illegal migration process.

This research suggests the need for future research with a concentration on the explication of the role of these three networks –

smuggling groups, ethnic communities, and informal fund transfer systems – and for testing whether this theoretical model is culturally specific or has a broad application.

Global illegal migration is viewed as a market, in which human smuggling and informal fund transfer systems are proposed to function as illegal enterprises in the role of intermediary mechanisms.

For example, individual households in the origin country were merely the recipients of services offered by underground banks. The dashed line suggests that a direct connection between smuggling groups and underground banks has not yet been borne out due to the limitations of data.

Some reflections on the extant literature on Chinese underground banking systems

Since part of Passas’ study of underground banking systems worldwide (1999) is directly pertinent to the operation of Chinese underground banks, a comparison of the findings between these two studies is necessary. On the surface, the current research seems to agree with Passas’ general findings that violence is not a dominant feature in underground banking operation, and Chinese underground bank systems do not present a serious threat . However, a careful examination suggests that these two research studies not only differ in several aspects of their findings (except for the finding regarding the use of violence), but also come to different conclusions.

The author of the present study has reasons to believe that some of the conclusions produced by Passas’ research might be prematurely drawn. For example, his findings suggest a unidirectional monetary flow in the transactions through underground banks in transferring lawfully earned money from the U.S. to mainland China. In fact, according to the current research, the nature of the funds flowing through Chinese underground banks is more complex than what Passas’ study suggests. The respondents’ accounts and the testimony

108 Financing Illegal Migration from the court trials of Sister Ping’s case provide compelling evidence that those earnings were likely illegitimate as well as legitimate. As for the direction of monetary flow, it remains unclear because we do not have access to information available only to human smugglers and the operators of underground banks based in NYC and Fujian, China. Another finding of this research contradicting that of Passas’ study is that the counterparts of underground banks in the U.S. paid the respondents’ families in Fujian hard currency instead of Chinese currency, as suggested by Passas’ information source, and thus did not handle the business relating to converting foreign currency for their clients. Additionally, remitting services provided by Chinese underground banks violate laws of the hosting country, the United States, not merely the laws of P.R. China. Finally, the researcher takes issue with the major conclusion of Passas’ study that the Chinese “informal value transfer systems” may not be a grave concern (pp. 18–20). An analysis of the changing configuration of the remittance market highlights the potential financial abuse due to the specialized use of the surviving underground banks in the Fujianese community.

Undoubtedly, Passas’ study provides a valuable reference frame for this explorative study. However, the divergences in research findings between the two studies seem obvious. They could be ascribed to the specific target population for the present research, the illegal immigrant clients of the informal financial systems and the firsthand data derived from their responses to the in-depth interviews.

Policy implications

The United States

The implications of this study for law enforcement are particularly relevant in the context of a fierce and polarizing national debate on illegal immigration. From the inception of the IRCA in 1986, the U.S. government has placed national priority on enhancing border enforcement. However, it is unclear whether intensive border control works as a deterrent in curtailing the influx of illegal immigrants in the long run. The expanded level of resources required makes such a restrictive measure a fiscal burden (Andreas, 2001, pp. 108–122).

Unintended negative effects of tightening border control further complicate the situation. Enhanced border control increases the cost

Facilitating Role of Underground Banks 109

and peril of illegal entry, hence raising demand for the services of professional human smugglers. Paradoxically, heightened border enforcement may give rise to increased complexity of the criminality involved in human smuggling, in order to overcome the barriers to entry, and fuel the growth of market transactions implicating corrupt government officials who provide fraudulent documents to smuggling groups (V ä yrynen, 2005, pp. 146–149). Intensified border control may produce a displacement effect whereby would-be illegal immigrants will move to other, less-controlled areas to seek opportunities for border-crossing, using the skills, knowledge, and expertise of human smuggling groups (Andreas, 2001, p. 115). In the light of these considerations, the growing challenge of curbing illegal migration heightens the importance of seeking alternative strategies.

In recent years, policies and measures that focus on financial investigation are considered by the authorities and scholars as a promising alternative. The September 11 attack in the U.S. brought into focus the potential for criminal abuse of informal fund transfer systems (IFTs). Their anonymity, the absence of standardized record-keeping, the lack of transparency in payment settlement, and the freedom from regulatory oversight place IFTs at risk of misuse (IMF, 2005). IFT

systems could be used for money-laundering and terrorist-financing, tax evasion, capital flight, or smuggling (El Qorchi et al., 2003). In order to address the concerns about the vulnerability of the informal remittance systems to financial abuse, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) put forward Special Recommendations (FATF SR. IV) in October, 2001. With a view to fighting terrorist financing, one of these recommendations was directly pertinent to informal remittance systems. In suggesting the compliance of all countries, the FATF’s recommendations included licensing/registration, 2 customer identification, and suspicious transaction reporting to be applicable to money/value transfer systems (MVTs) in all jurisdictions (FATF, 2002). 3 For the purposes of enhancing the transparency of money flows through informal channels, a broader definition of informal remittance systems, as reflected in the term money or value transfer service (MVT service), was used in a Best Practices Paper issued by the FATF in 2003 (FATF, 2003). 4

U.S. regulatory policy requires that informal remittance operators register their businesses at the federal level with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and obtain licensing at the

110 Financing Illegal Migration state level. Failure to comply with licensing requirements is punish-able under heavy sanctions as a federal felony. Current laws, such as the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act, also require that informal remittance operators follow customer identification procedures (for certain transactions), keep financial records, and file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) and Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) (Maimbo & Passas, 2004).

According to the findings of this research, Fujianese-controlled underground banks do not seem seriously harmful . They are not technically or morally as “bad” as the established commercial vices, such as drug trafficking, gambling, and prostitution. That Chinese underground banks played a facilitating role one decade ago, both in fueling a drive toward illegal migration in the sending communities through human smuggling and in expediting the settlement process for the old generation of illegal immigrants in the U.S., does not press a strong case for the full suppression of underground banks. On the other hand, evidence produced in this research suggests a noteworthy shift toward the use of legitimate channels among the new generation of illegal immigrants, indicating a possible slide by the formal sector into the role that underground banks used to play with regard to Fujianese illegals.

Additionally, the bifurcating effect of the changing configuration of the remittance market could make Chinese underground banks problematic in that the specialized use of underground banks is more likely to be restricted to a group of “prominent” clients who have motives to use the service of underground banks for illegitimate purposes. These may constitute the chief concerns of the law enforcement authorities. The following proposed policy measures address these concerns.

Desirable as the financial regulations described above are, it would be considerably difficult, if not next to impossible, to implement these policies to regulate Chinese-run money transfer systems in practice. First of all, Chinese illegal immigrants have been increasingly dependent on formal channels such as MTOs and banking institutions for money transfer purposes. On the surface this sounds like good news, since to induce immigrants to use formal channels for fund transfers has been a major concern for both receiving and hosting countries. But this shift may betray some serious problems with the formal channels intent on expanding their business among immigrant groups.

Facilitating Role of Underground Banks 111

This change raises an important question. In the light of their aggressive marketing strategies and dubious business practices, is it possible that these formal channels will take the place of underground banks, serving similar functions for illegal immigrants?

According to the experience of the smuggled Fujianese under this study, the answer is very likely positive. The findings of the research suggest that the remitting services provided by some of these formal institutions are attractive to the more recent generation of Chinese illegal immigrants, not only because of their low cost and the extensive remittance distribution networks in mainland China, but also because the agents of these institutions whose service targets illegal immigrant groups may be less concerned with compliance with regulatory frameworks.

This knowledge may alert the competent authorities to review policy in order to perform a major overhaul of the internal management and implementation of financial regulations among MTOs, which offer business outreach to immigration groups. Meanwhile, great care should be taken by the authorities in undertaking such actions, which could fuel cultural tensions and worsen the “them versus us” mentality among Fujianese immigrants. They may consider communicating to the local ethnic communities the message that the high-quality remittance business aiming at servicing immigration groups will not be disrupted, but be enhanced with a more transparent, well-monitored payment flow in order to reduce the risk of criminal abuse.

Second, the interview data show that Fujianese illegal immigrants distrust the American government. They perceive the government as the cardinal enemy, which is mobilizing all resources to drive illegal immigrants out of the U.S. This deep-seated fear makes it hard for them to cooperate with the authorities. In addition, underground bank owners might believe that any requirements of licensing/ registration and suspicious transaction reporting will simply deprive them of the advantages of their business over formal channels, rendering their existence meaningless. As a result, Chinese remittance businesses would be resistant to financial regulation and are not registered or licensed; hence they are operating beyond the regulatory regime of the authorities. Chinese underground banks might create more problems for law enforcement agencies than licensed remittance businesses because they are difficult to track down. They never openly advertise their services in the media.

112 Financing Illegal Migration In addition, unlike their counterparts in China, which may utilize the deposit and settlement mechanism of the formal banking system, Chinese underground banks operating in the U.S. and their agents in China are found to have no interface with the formal financial sector.

That means, the settlements are completely free from supervision by the regulatory authorities, which increases the risk of financial abuse (Zhao, 2007). Fujianese immigrants view underground banks in positive terms based on the widely-held perception that informal remittance systems operated by co-ethnics offer the community an indispensable service. There is no incentive for clients to inform authorities about the illegal activities of co-ethnics. To say the least, the closely-knit Fujianese community, built as it is on dialect-specific networks, is very hard for outsiders to penetrate.

Accordingly, as far as combating Chinese smuggling is concerned, the U.S. authorities may need to adjust their strategies and goals by integrating the financial links in the control of illegal immigration flows. As long as the ethnic market for informal remittance services exists, those informal remittance service providers are not expected to be completely wiped out by “strike hard” approaches, although they might drop out of view and stay dormant under the heat of government crackdowns for a while. Then they will return when a ripe market opportunity appears. As a result, the goal of policy measures is to focus on regulation rather than prohibition (Buencamino & Gorbunov, 2002; McCusker, 2005).

The research suggests that underground banking systems are embedded in the fabric of the ethnic community. Because of this, the American authorities may need to come to terms with the problem of the “embeddedness” of underground banks. The establishment of a partnership between law enforcement agencies and local communities is an essential step toward enforcing regulation-oriented policy measures in a “consensus-building consultation”

process (Maimbo & Passas, 2004). The research findings show that the networks and resources of ethnic communities make them a natural milieu for major players to converge: the clientele and operators of underground banks engaging in open transactions in a safe setting free of authorities’ external intervention. The authorities may need to reach out to the local Chinese communities, which should be engaged in the process of development and implementation of regulatory standards and supervisory frameworks. It is suggested that

Facilitating Role of Underground Banks 113

not only should the authorities’ regulatory concerns be made known to the community, but also those standards and supervisory framework should integrate the community’s own interests and concerns (Maimbo & Passas, 2004).

Less active and conspicuous activities of underground banks since the mid-1990s might be a result of unfavorable market conditions, enhanced by authorities’ crackdowns and operatives targeting Chinese human smuggling groups after the 1993 “Golden Venture”

incident. The strategies described above help to adjust the conventional crime-control orientations and complement the traditional approach of mainly pursuing individual criminals. On the one hand, the attention of the authorities is directed to more hidden forms of misconduct engaged by formal remittance agencies, which could be turned into providers of illegal services in an attempt to expand their market share. On the other hand, the active presence of law enforcement as a partner of the local community in crime control would probably add pressure on both the operators and the clients of underground banks whose operation may continue in the community.

Although this research is not specifically designed to investigate the direct role of Chinese-operated underground banks in financing human smuggling, the ultimate goal of this research is to lay a foundation for future research in this direction. An overview of a recent trend reveals that human smuggling from Fujian Province persists today, albeit on a much smaller scale than one decade ago, and signs have been evident of the spread of human smuggling into other regions of China, such as Zhejiang Province and the Northeastern regions (Liang & Morooka, 2001; Zhang, 1997). The smuggled population tends to be younger, and the number of minors among illegal entrants is on the rise (“Child smugglers under arrest,” 2005; Kotlowitz, 2006). Teenagers from Fujian have been found to have been smuggled into Britain and forced into prostitution (Scott-Clark & Levy, 2008). Scholars as well as law enforcement agencies are concerned that trafficking women and adolescents for sexual exploitation could become a new, specialized branch of human smuggling groups (Salt & Stein, 1997).

More importantly, the interview data show that another type of underground banking system in Chinatown, NYC, has been active among Fujianese immigrants: rotation credit associations.

Several

114 Financing Illegal Migration respondents in this study explained to the researcher that this type of qianzhuang is very popular among both legal and illegal immigrants who are in need of cash for a wide variety of purposes, such as obtaining loans for smuggling fees, repaying smuggling debts, buying houses, or starting up businesses. One respondent confessed that he used both types of qianzhuang for the purpose of getting loans for the repayment of his own smuggling debt and for the payment of his brother’s smuggling fee, aside from sending money home back to China (Respondent) . The interview data raise an important concern as to whether these two systems operate side by side in facilitating illegal immigration.

Given China’s huge population and the pushing forces engendered by the current economic development model in China, the researcher contends that the modernization process in China may continue to feed illegal immigration through human smuggling (Scott-Clark & Levy, 2008; Zhao, 2008). Furthermore, nearly two decades after Fujianese illegal workers first settled in the U.S., social problems pertaining to this group of immigrants have begun to surface, challenging the hosting society in the areas of social service, education, health care, and public welfare (Bernstein, 2006 ). Of course, it is beyond the scope of this research to elaborate on these points. However, this tendency of a continued illegal immigration flow from China highlights the importance of productive alternatives to conventional efforts at fighting human smuggling. Even though the current research did not produce evidence indicating underground banks’ direct involvement in the human smuggling trade, these informal financial systems, as an illicit intermediary suspected of financing illegal emigration, make them an area of concern which the authorities may want to take seriously.

Recent research shows that developing and implementing restrictive policies with priority given to heightened border control may be insufficient to meet the great challenge posed by this expanding global phenomenon of human smuggling or trafficking, and may even be counter-productive (Hagan & Phillips, 2008). One implication of the present research is that in order for these strategies to achieve the optimal effects, they need to be considered in conjunc-tion with the alternative approach, which calls for increased monitoring and supervision of informal and formal remittance channels.

Facilitating Role of Underground Banks 115

P.R. China

Where combating against human smuggling and curbing the growth of underground banks are concerned, the Chinese government is presented with formidable challenges, because a seemingly regional problem evident in a part of Fujian could be a symptom of broader problems inherent in institutional deficiencies, which the Chinese government seems to lack political will to deal with. Of course, it is beyond the scope of this thesis to examine and analyze how the fundamental institutional problems in China are associated with large-scale illegal migration through human smuggling and the prevalent use of the services of underground banks in certain coastal regions (e.g. Fujian Province). The discussion of this section is limited to two issues directly related to the subject under study. One of the issues involves the main clientele of both cross-border human smuggling and underground banks in the U.S. – Fujianese peasants – while the other concerns the state-controlled Chinese financial sector, of which underground banks are seen as a strong competitor.

The current research findings reveal that remittances were not used by emigrant households as investments to stimulate the local economy. The inclination to direct conspicuous spending at purposes other than family maintenance produced an impetus among non-emigrant families in home communities to send their own family members abroad through human smuggling to generate extra income. Hence, one implication for local governments in emigrant communities in China may be that they should consider turning more attention to enhancing the development impact of remittances in major emigrant communities according to the locales’ specific economic conditions (Ghosh, 1992).

First of all, local governments in emigrant communities need to change the perceptions ingrained in local areas that illegal migration is a quick fix or short-cut to local economic development without a need for extensive investment (Chin, 1999). Second, the small positive contribution of remittances to the local economy in Fujian may reflect the lack of viable investment opportunities in home communities. Effective government programs can be developed to direct remittances to finance viable small businesses and provide technical assistance, the success of which could draw more inflow of remittances (Ghosh, 1992). There are examples of success in the productive use of remittances for rural development purposes in some Central

116 Financing Illegal Migration American countries (e.g. El Salvador), Asian and African countries (e.g. Korea & Morocco) (Ghosh, 1992; Russell, 1992; Wucker, 2004).

Weighing a promising job prospect at home and a protracted plan for debt repayment by toiling in a sweatshop in the U.S., a would-be Chinese migrant is likely to have second thoughts about joining the ranks of illegal immigrants. Potentially, this is the most effective means of curtailing massive emigration through human smuggling in China.

As suggested in the analysis in Chapter 2 , local Chinese underground banks in the course of market-oriented economic reform sprout up as a response to rising legitimate market demands. The reform in the financial sector has not been successful in shifting the functions of the state banks from “government policy agents” to

“market-driven financial intermediaries” (Wolf et al., 2003, p. 127).

Worse still, the government has not loosened control over the allocation of capital as the largest shareholder in the state financial institutions. Given the lack of accessibility to credit, the inefficiency of state banks, and inadequately developed capital markets, private enterprises naturally turn to informal financial intermediaries such as underground banks for financing.

That the operation of underground banks outside official control makes them a convenient vehicle for illegal and criminal activities has been an intractable problem for the central government. The Chinese government reacted with alarm to the proliferation of underground banks since the late 1990s , as the operation of underground banks obviously was viewed to have encroached on the domain of state banks, and contravened state foreign exchange controls. A 1998

law outlawed underground banks and other informal financial institutions. 5 Under pressure from the central government, local authorities periodically launch campaigns against underground banks due to concerns about their connections to a host of evils, such as money laundering and corruption. Nonetheless, little evidence suggests that the get-tough approach has achieved desirable results. Chinese underground banks are reportedly booming (“Worried about illicit lending,” 2007) , and display a strong tendency to expand from South China into the hinterlands in the west and the coastal regions in the north (Tschang, 2005 ). The evidence from this study shows that Chinese underground banks located in Fujian Province collaborate with their overseas counterparts in facilitating clandestine Chinese

Facilitating Role of Underground Banks 117

migration. Hopefully, the evidence will not be used to justify legis-lative prohibition and the prevailing get-tough stance adopted by the Chinese government. There are good reasons to expect that crackdown strategies in China will bring about unintended adverse consequences, such as driving these informal financial institutions further underground to facilitate a wide variety of criminal activities like money laundering. This raises questions about the efficacy of this oversimplistic crime control approach.

It is suggested that the government strive to deepen banking reform toward increased liberalization, as its repressive policy does not redress the root cause of the resurgence of underground banks.

One major step would be to relinquish the monopoly accorded state banks, allowing for competition from non-state banks, and to de-criminalize the operation of underground banks. In this way, the private sector would have more legal access to loans from the banking institutions, while the operation of underground banks would be brought into line with the standard practices of conventional financial institutions and be subject to similar regulatory requirements, thus diminishing the possibility of their being abused by criminal elements or corrupted by illegal money.

Conclusion

As the first exploratory study on the Chinese underground banking system in the U.S., the research draws a general impression of their clientele through in-depth interviews of a group of 27 undocumented Chinese migrant workers. The impression is based on the personal experiences of those Chinese illegal migrant workers interviewed, given that a representative sample is difficult to obtain among a population of illegal immigrants. The information they imparted sheds light on the nature, scope, operating style, mechanism, and role of the informal fund transfer systems connected with illegal migration and human smuggling. The perspectives of illegal immigrants are particularly instrumental in offering insights into the importance of complex networks encompassing human smuggling groups and ethnic communities, which seem crucial for the development of an illegal market and the sustained operation of these systems.

The research finds that the rise and fall of underground banks was contingent on the change of market conditions and the intensity

118 Financing Illegal Migration of the government crackdowns on illegal immigration. The influence of underground banks on the market as well as on immigrants’

lives was found to be strongest in a specific period between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. These informal institutions operated alongside the formal financial sector, but they became a preferred vehicle for transferring remittances home among a large proportion of illegal immigrants because of their unique “strengths” in filling a service gap: They were able to turn the deficiencies of the formal sector to their advantage in meeting particular demands of an immigrant group, Chinese illegal migrant workers, by offering a reliable, anonymous, and speedy service. Contrary to those using the earlier generations of informal fund transfer systems , the main clientele of the contemporary system are illegal immigrants who were smuggled into the U.S. to stay as long as they could gain access to avenues for legalization . The findings also reveal the declining influence of the systems over the years, and the possibility of formal remittance transfer mechanism replacing informal institutions in facilitating the completion of the process of illegal migration. The surviving underground banks seem to be at a higher risk of financial abuse since their shrinking clientele may have more incentive to use them in running illegitimate businesses. The findings presented in this study lend support for illegal enterprise theory, particularly when the involvement of organized crime is at issue. This research fills an important gap in the literature on remittances and informal fund transfer systems, which fail to distinguish legal immigrants from illegal immigrants. They also tend to ignore the possible negative impacts of remittances flowing through informal channels on economic development in home communities of immigrants, which may play a significant role perpetuating human smuggling in the context of transnational Chinese illegal labor migration.

This study holds the potential for informing the discourse on illegal labor migration and human smuggling. It also highlights the importance of policy measures with greater emphasis on financial investigation and monitoring of formal financial institutions. Human smuggling is now treated as a security threat among the developed countries in the West (Hagan & Phillips, 2008 ). Additionally, security concerns could become a rationale for the increased regulations of formal remittance transfer channels. These research findings suggest that the focus of a sound financial regulatory and supervisory

Facilitating Role of Underground Banks 119

framework is to enhance the level of transparency and accountability of informal financial intermediaries lest the unmonitored systems are driven further underground. Currently, a disquieting prospect is looming large with the expansion of Chinese illegal migration beyond Fujian Province into other coastal regions, indicating that the illegal immigration stream aided through human smuggling may persist in the future (Thun Ø & Pieke, 2005). The early generation of underground banks thrived at the height of the smuggling of Fujianese immigrants, which occurred as a newly opened-up China was beginning to gain global economic prowess. So it remains an issue whether underground banks could resurge, given that momentum might be gathering for a new wave of illegal migration against a backdrop of global recession, as the export-oriented manufacturing industry in China, which is absorbing a large proportion of the surplus labor force, is hit the hardest in coastal cities. It is the responsibility of the U.S. authorities as well as scholars to keep monitoring the changes of the demand on remittance and illegal labor market . Additionally, further research will be needed to ascertain the extent of the involvement of other types of underground banking system, such as rotating credit associations, in financing illegal labor migration through human smuggling.

Appendix: Research Methods

Methodology: recruitment and interview of Chinese illegal immigrants in the U.S.

The aims of this research are exploratory and descriptive for several reasons: (1) No systematic and qualitative study on the connections between Chinese underground banks and illegal immigration exists. As such, qualitative research methods are employed to address the key questions outlined above . (2) The secrecy and illegality involved in the operation of Chinese underground banks present considerable difficulties in obtaining appropriate data. To date there are no quantitative data relating to Chinese underground banks either in the U.S. or in China. A qualitative research study becomes an appropriate approach, which begins with finding users of underground banks, who were illegal immigrants living in the United States – though this approach is not without its own challenges. (3) The task of identifying research subjects for face-to-face qualitative research from such a difficult-to-reach population as unlicensed underground

bank owners or clients who are predominantly unauthorized immigrant workers is exceedingly challenging. Illegal immigrants are reluctant to make themselves known or may be afraid to talk about how their money is moved around, while underground bank owners avoid talking to outsiders for fear of detection of their covert business or identities they may wish to keep secret.

In addition, to have a good chance of a reasonable discussion with research subjects, the researcher had to be cognizant of the increasing complexity of the Chinese underground banking system that has firmly gained a foothold in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and that has received little scholarly attention in the academic literature. As a result, the researcher focused on the users of Chinese underground banks located in Chinatown, NYC, in the belief that such a focused approach would contribute to the beginning of an understanding of a hidden, illicit financial institution by examining contextual factors underlying the role of underground banks, the interaction between clients and underground banks, and the impact of illegal financing on illegal immigration.

Design of the study

In this research a special inquiry is made into how underground banks located in Chinatown, NYC, served the needs of illegal immigrants residing in NYC and the Philadelphia area and affected the lives of their families back in China. The data collection strategy for this study relied on 120

Appendix: Research Methods 121

face-to-face surveys and interviews. Direct observation as a participant or a non- participant was out of the question for reasons of safety and access.

The unit of study is the individual client instead of the underground bank owner or operator. At this stage, interviews of owners would simply not be feasible given their secrecy and illegality. Thus, the strategy was to learn about underground banks by speaking with their clients, following the rationale suggested by Smith that focusing on “an illicit enterprise’s clients, suppliers or competitors may result in more sophisticated and effective control strategies” (Smith, 1980, p. 16). The in-depth interviews of Fujianese illegal immigrants in NYC and Philadelphia were preceded by a structured survey consisting of 36 closed-ended questions with categorical response items. The combined use of survey and interview was intended to enhance the validity of the data (for details see the discussion in “Validity issues: Bias and reactivity ”). The questions asked research subjects about general background information, sources of smuggling loans, the location and method of smuggling fee payment, their smuggling experiences, and their experiences with underground banks. The second part of the data collection was a semi-structured interview containing 43 open-ended questions, leaving ample room for probing. These questions aimed at encouraging research subjects to freely give their views, feelings, and detailed accounts of the process of and experience using the service of underground banks. Both the survey and the interview script were first written in Chinese, and then translated into English by the researcher. They were pretested to a small number of research subjects, and further revisions were made to address validity issues concerning bias and reactivity.

Findings from ethnographic observations of Fujianese communities in Chinatown, NYC, are used to complement the survey and interview data obtained from immigrants in NYC and Philadelphia. The researcher conducted observational (ethnographic) fieldwork in the area near East Broadway, dubbed “Fuzhou Town,” in Chinatown, NYC. She learned from the informants that this is the area where underground banks used to thrive and may still remain. These on-site observations gave the researcher a vivid impression of the physical milieu where underground banks operated with a storefront disguise and the ways Fujianese immigrants interacted with one another as patrons and proprietors in going about their business. These findings are reported in Chapters 2 and 3.

Aside from the primary data, a secondary source of data was derived from systematically reviewing news reports in the mainstream press to complement the primary information. To identify contemporary issues pertinent to the subject, the search of major newspapers in English focused on those published in the northeastern regions, including the New York Times , New York Daily News , New York Post , Philadelphia Inquirer , and Washington Post .

The major media sources in English published outside the U.S. included the South China Morning Post (Hong Kong), the Guardian and the Financial Times (UK). Another source of information on the subject was mainstream magazines, such as Time , Newsweek , and U.S. News and World Report . The electronic

122 Appendix: Research Methods

journals in Chinese included in the research were primarily Duowei Post and Huaxia Digest , which enjoy general popularity among Chinese immigrants in the U.S.

Research sites

New York City and the Greater Philadelphia metropolitan area served as the main research sites for this study due to constraints on funding and resources. New York City is the first stop for the vast majority of illegal immigrants upon arrival in the U.S. and also is the ideal choice for their settlement because of the vibrant ethnic economy there. The city is said to have provided numerous job opportunities for the largest Fujianese illegal population in the U.S. (Kwong, 1997). The majority of interviewees had resided in NYC before they moved into other cities like Philadelphia, while a few of them still live there at the end of this research. Through conversations with many Fujianese immigrants, the researcher’s general impression was that Fujianese immigrants reflected a strong preference for going about their major business in Chinatown, NYC, due to the dense networks and emotional ties associated with the Fujianese community there. That does not imply that all underground banks are located in NYC, or that there are none in Philadelphia.

These statements can only be verified against the accounts of interviewees.

There were other reasons for selecting the Chinese community in Philadelphia. Philadelphia is the second choice of residence for many Fujianese immigrants due to its proximity to NYC, which is considered

“home” in the minds of Fujianese illegal immigrants. According to the interviewees who participated in this study, a mixed set of reasons motivated them to move out of NYC into Philadelphia. These reasons include the high rents, cost of living and fierce competition in the NYC job market, relocations of their families or relatives, new job openings, or business opportunities in Philadelphia. Philadelphia’s advantageous geographic position and convenient transportation make it easy for them to retain connections with their kinsmen and friends still residing in NYC, and to maintain the economic, social, and cultural ties they have established there, including using underground banks located in NYC.

For the purpose of this research, focusing on clients of Chinese underground banks, Philadelphia offers a reasonably representative Chinese community populated by Fujianese illegal immigrants from which to draw research subjects. Although Philadelphia does not host a population of Fujianese illegal immigrants as large and diverse as that in NYC, the thriving ethnic economy in Chinatown of Philadelphia and the city’s geographic location allow it to become a most attractive job market and place of residence next to NYC for Fujianese immigrants in recent years.

Selection of the sample

Obviously, the creation of a probability-based sample for the study would be impractical, given the respondents’ illegal status and their need for secrecy.

Appendix: Research Methods 123

The research subjects to be interviewed were selected from Fujianese illegal immigrants who reside in New York City and Philadelphia through a snowball sampling technique (see below). Potential interviewees were restricted to adults who had illegally entered the U.S. primarily through human smuggling since the mid-1980s, and who used to be the clients of underground banks in Chinatown, NYC, regardless of their current residence. Previous research suggests that this type of Fujianese illegal accounts for the majority of the Chinese illegal immigrant population in the U.S. The previous studies of illegal Fujianese immigrants have already identified characteristics of Fujianese illegals smuggled into the U.S. to inform the pool of subjects: they are predominately married males with a junior high education level, and the sample population is widely distributed in Chinese-controlled labor-intensive businesses such as restaurants, garment factories, and construction businesses (Chin, J.K., 2003; Chin, K., 1999; Kwong, 1997; Liang, 1998 ).

A snowball sampling approach to identifying the interview sample was used because, of course, there is no list of the general population of Fujianese illegals from which to construct an appropriate sampling frame. Thirty subjects were recruited for the study. Although snowball sampling is a nonprobability sampling method, which does not permit generalizations to a total study population, it nevertheless “offer[s] the benefits of not requiring a list of all possible elements in a full population and the ability to access otherwise highly sensitive or difficult-to-reach study populations” (Berg, 2004). In addition to the small size of sample and restriction to two research sites, the nonprobability sampling used in this study has the limitation that it may produce a biased sample when referrals may consist of people with homogenous attributes (Lee, 1993 ). However, this method is justifiable and of great value in exploratory research when there is little other choice in accessing a difficult population and handling a sensitive issue (Biernacki & Waldorf, 1981).

The researcher found that Fujianese immigrants generally were unwilling to participate in a study which involved such highly sensitive issues, like illegal immigration and inquiries into how they moved money across borders, particularly against a backdrop of well-publicized arrests in immigration raids. These perceptions of fear mixed with suspicion of the researcher’s motives were widely shared by Fujianese immigrants without legal status as well as legalized Fujianese to whom the researcher attempted to reach out directly or indirectly. The identity of the researcher as a student researcher and a non-Fujianese speaker added to the accessibility barriers. Thus, the researcher decided to narrow the scope of the search for potential cooperative interviewees to local community Chinese churches, which turned out to be a viable strategy. The source of potential interviewees came from four Chinese churches, three in Philadelphia, and one in NYC. The interviewees were not necessarily all Christians, since some were students at ESL (English as a Second Language) classes held by the churches, while others attended gatherings hosted by a Fujianese Christian fellowship within a local church.

The researcher did not find any evidence suggesting that being a member

124 Appendix: Research Methods

of a Christian church would result in substantial differences in the reports of the respondents because the narratives of the non-Christian respondents regarding their use of and views about underground banks were found to be highly consistent with those of Christian respondents.

In order to avoid confusion when approaching them, the researcher located four Fujianese natives and one Fujianese-speaker (who is not of Fujian origin but can speak fluent Fujianese dialect thanks to her marriage to a Fujianese native) to assist in the recruitment process. They helped the researcher to gain an entrée into the circle of this special group of Fujianese immigrants.

Their focus was on people in the same church who were familiar with these five “middlemen.” Those they contacted first were asked for more referrals.

In spite of the constraints on representativeness posed by the snowball sampling method, measures were taken to include various types of subject.

The researcher tried to avoid selecting family members or close friends of other respondents to ensure diversity in the sample. Because Fujianese illegal immigrants are primarily employed as workers in restaurants, the construction business, and garment factories, a rough semi-quota sampling was employed to draw samples providing adequate representation and diversity of the illegal population, where conditions permitted. Restaurant workers were oversampled because Fujianese illegals are highly concentrated in this business. The interviewees possessed similar demographic attributes to, for example, those selected for Chin’s study of Fujianese human smuggling with 300 cases (see Chin, 1999). The majority of the participants in this research came from rural Fujian, a significant proportion of the interviewees hailing from Changle County. Their ages ranged from 24 to 52 at the time of the interview. Most of them were married, male, and leaving families behind at the time of arrival in the U.S. The selection of the sample seemed to reach a cross-section of smuggled Fujianese, less than a quarter of them being peasants or fishermen while others were engaged in varied occupations back in China. Nearly half of the interviewees are now working in the restaurant business, and a little more than half have been in the U.S.

for at least ten years.

Interview process

The researcher found that it was helpful to be introduced to potential interviewees by an intermediary, for example, a church leader, so as to mitigate potential interviewees’ distrust to a certain degree. Yet it was still difficult to gain the trust of potential interviewees. To address this difficulty the researcher ensured that potential interviewees became comfort with her presence in the church or group activities so that she would be less likely to be considered an “alien” (in the sense that she is a non-Fujianese) and threatening (due to her identity, which was sometimes mistaken for a journalist or a government agent among low-educated Fujianese immigrants). The researcher spent at least four months attending a Fujianese Christian fellowship at least once a week, and went to Sunday sermons at the churches in Philadelphia and NYC.

She also volunteered for various services for the immigrants at the churches,

Appendix: Research Methods 125

and attended various group activities, such as Bible studies on weekdays and Sundays. Admittedly, it was extremely difficult to establish close relationships and build a rapport with potential interviewees, given that the majority of them work unusually long hours (this was especially so for those interviewees who were restaurant workers). Furthermore, potential interviewees generally avoided contact with outsiders who showed a particular interest in their personal histories, which they believed should be safely and forever hidden. The researcher’s overall impression was that Fujianese immigrants were not eager to share their stories or experiences with an outsider.

Some of them would explain this reluctance to the researcher by asserting,

“We Fujianese are very baoshou .” 1 As a result, it was difficult to locate eligible interviewees who were willing to speak openly. However, over time some candidates whom the researcher approached directly or indirectly through the “middlemen” began to accept her and show their willingness to participate in the study by leaving their contact numbers or making an appoint-ment for an interview.

Language presented another challenge. The analysis of this unique, self-protective defense mechanism based on a regional dialect can be found in Chapter 6 . The interviews were conducted by the researcher herself. Only three of the interviews were completed by one of the four Fujianese intermediaries as mentioned above. The researcher originally planned to hire him as an interviewer, but later had to change the plan because he with-drew from the research process shortly after the interview process began.

The researcher, who did not speak Fuzhounese dialect, found later that the research subjects spoke Mandarin, the standard spoken language used by Chinese. So the interview process proceeded in Mandarin. The locations for the interviews varied from a subject’s church or his or her home, to a mall, or any other agreed-upon place. 2 The interview would be set at a time convenient for the subjects, accommodating their working schedules.

The design originally called for face-to-face interviews. But not all of the interviews could be completed in such a manner. Since Fujianese immigrants work unusually long hours, and only have one day off a week, many times a face-to-face interview could not be completed within the scheduled time. The researcher therefore on occasion had to follow up by completing the interview by phone after the interviewee had finished work at night.

These interviews were completed with research subjects following the same casual, open-ended, but guided conversational form. Interviews generally lasted between 30 minutes and two hours, depending on how cooperative the interviewee was, and how much detail he or she could remember or was willing to divulge. The richness and level of detailed information thus elicited was connected with the rapport achieved by the researcher as well as the personality of the interviewee.

Consent

The researcher sought the consent of subjects in advance. Given the low education and literacy level of the interviewees, the sensitive nature of

126 Appendix: Research Methods

the research, and the illegal status of some of the interviewees, any formal procedure, such as presenting a consent form neatly printed with the school’s letterhead, or requirement for signatures would undoubtedly have been poorly understood and likely to scare potential interviewees off. The researcher had to find a suitable way of obtaining informed consent from potential interviewees. Instead of reading a consent statement, or giving the subject the document to study, the researcher explained to the subject the purposes of the research and the promise of confidentiality, and obtained consent through a discussion with the potential interviewee.

Note-taking

Note-taking and audio-taping during the interview sessions would have provided a reliable, verbatim record of the interviewee’s accounts, and would have served as a very useful basis for interview transcripts. However, because of the very sensitive considerations of the personal safety and security of potential interviewees, these methods could not be employed as the researcher had planned. For one reason, taping would raise fears that the information collected from subjects would be released to police, or be used as evidence against them in other ways. Generally, the subjects of this study felt extremely nervous about the idea of tape-recording, and as a result, audio-taping was never used. Instead, the researcher would ask for a subject’s prior consent when she needed to take notes in his or her presence. In instances when the researcher noticed that note-taking during the conversation produced a bad reaction in an interviewee, the researcher ceased. Transcription or fuller expansion of notes had to be carried out at the completion of the interview, out of the presence of the subject. Following this procedure the interviewer immediately wrote down what she had learned from an informant while the memory was still fresh. In this case, the accuracy of the detailed information from an interview was highly dependent on the researcher’s memory. This strategy has been employed in other research in addressing similarly sensitive issues. 3

Summary

In sum, the sensitivity of the research topic posed formidable challenges for data collection. Thorny and delicate problems arose at every phrase of the recruiting and interviewing process. The recruitment process was probably among the most time-consuming and most challenging of the tasks. The preliminary pilot research by the author suggested that there should be quite a large number of Fujianese immigrants who met the eligibility requirements for this research (i.e. they were among those who were smuggled into the U.S. and used underground banks). But at a time of heightened enforcement of immigration law, attempting to engage Fujianese immigrants in open and honest conversations about the research topics was highly sensitive to prospective Fujianese immigrant interviewees, and was likely to be met with suspicion and hostility. Even some legal immigrants had reservations about whether this research might do harm to the image of the Fujianese

Appendix: Research Methods 127

community, or, for example, to renowned underground bank owners such as Sister Ping, who is now serving prison time (see Chapter 5 ). The researcher’s identity as an outsider and an academic reinforced the potential subjects’

suspicion and added significantly to the obstacles faced in data collection.

Taking into account all these considerations, however, the researcher developed a strategy for locating prospective interviewees by relying on contacts who would assist her in gaining entry into the subjects’ circle. This approach became critical in data collection. For example, the researcher found that it was in a smaller church in Philadelphia rather than a large church in NYC

that the majority of the potential interviewees were able to be located. Yet, even after many hours spent “hanging out with” certain groups of Fujianese immigrants in both Philadelphia and NYC, the researcher could not locate a single eligible and willing interviewee who could be approached directly in the absence of a “middleman.”

Even when subjects were identified, the researcher still had to screen interviewees who were initially considered qualified. For example, some potential interviewees, usually latecomers, were confused about the topic and may have mistaken the agents of Western Union for the operators of an underground bank. Other obstacles included more mundane difficulties, such as agreeing upon the time and location of interviews, which was sometimes a serious problem for busy subjects working long hours. Their demanding work schedules significantly hindered efforts to build close working relationships with subjects. The language used for the interview had to be changed from the Fuzhounese dialect to Mandarin Chinese, as a result of the withdrawal of the original Fuzhounese-speaking interviewer. The unreliability of some interviewees in doing what they had agreed to do made it hard for the researcher to maintain a list of interviewees; interviewees could change their minds at any time. This problem of mind-changing happened particularly when subjects were brought face-to-face with the researcher, or when an interview could not be scheduled shortly after the first meeting. Even during an interview the researcher had to be alert for signs of withdrawal or restlessness from an interviewee, indicating a possible change of mind. The subject might become uneasy about some of the detailed and “intrusive”

questions that were asked. An interviewee could interrupt the interview by saying something to the effect that she or he “suddenly” had no recollection of his or her past experience of using an underground bank.

Validity issues: bias and reactivity

The research methods and data sources combined with the nature and circumstances of this study raise important validity questions. A special effort was made by the researcher to identify validity threats and to devise strategies to address them. Two major types of validity threat this study involved were: (1) possible researcher bias and (2) reactivity (Maxwell, 2005, p. 108). To deal with potential researcher bias, the researcher carefully examined her preconceptions and expectations about the phenomena

128 Appendix: Research Methods

under study and about research subjects throughout the process of research design and implementation. In addition, the researcher sought to be open to

“discrepant” evidence and interpretations which may have conflicted with preconceived propositions, and to report any such instances in discussions of the findings (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Other strategies included interviewing participants more than once, or soliciting interpretive feedback about data and findings from interviewees, which helped rule out the possibility that the researcher would misrepresent and misinterpret their personal accounts (Maxwell, 2005, p. 111).

To address concerns arising from reactivity, i.e. “the influence of the researcher on the setting or individuals studied” (Maxwell, 2005, p. 110), the researcher sought out evidence that most accurately captured the studied phenomenon, i.e. immigrants’ views and experiences relating to their use of illegal underground banks. Facing an interviewer with legal status, an illegal immigrant may consciously give understatements about his or her experiences of using underground banks. A valuable way to reduce the possibility of such misleading statements was to employ triangulation, that is, to gather and compare information from diverse sources and methods (Lewis & Ritchie, 2003, pp. 275–276). Triangulation is a widely-adopted strategy among qualitative researchers to strengthen the validity of data and the conclusions drawn. According to Becker (1970) , this strategy works by “counter[ing] the twin dangers of respondent duplicity and observer bias” (p. 53).

In this research, a two-part inquiry fusing survey and semi-structured interviews was designed to generate more valid data, in which some of the survey questions, phrased in a slightly different way, were repeated among the interview questions to permit assessment of reliability. The purpose of using blended types of data source was to yield detailed, less biased, and more credible information relating to the research questions. The topics tapped by the survey included the interviewees’ background information, their smuggling experience (e.g. source of loans, routes, smuggling fee payment, arrest record, duration of smuggling debt repayment), and their experience of using an underground bank (e.g. fees, frequency, amount remitted, purpose, number and locations of banks used). The responses gathered from the survey served as a starting point as well as a reference point leading the researcher to probe for elaboration in the interviewing process, whereas the data collected from interviews supplied detailed information about the subjects’ motives, the circumstances surrounding their use of underground banks, and the effects of using these informal channels on their lives in the U.S. and the lives of their families. Moreover, many interviewees were interviewed at least twice.

The information retrieved from the subjects from different sources (interviews and surveys) at different times was cross-checked to see whether there were any discrepancies or any important data were missing from the interviewees’ accounts.

The researcher also compared the findings by checking with other Fujianese immigrants who have friends, family members, or colleagues with experience of using underground banks, and the information (though

Appendix: Research Methods 129

very limited) gleaned from scholarly works and news reports. This method, termed triangulation, can be useful for strengthening the validity and reliability of qualitative data (Lewis & Richie, 2003; Merriam & Muhamad, 2002).

Inter-rate reliability is not applicable, thus not used in the analysis, because this is a measure of the extent of consistency in the rating among different raters or coders. The researcher was the only coder throughout the analytical process.

Confi dentiality and anonymity

This research involves certain aspects of private financial issues and the illegal status of Chinese immigrants. The sensitive nature of the data obtained required the researcher to develop an ethically-informed approach to achieve confidentiality and anonymity, respecting the safety and privacy of research subjects. To this end special attention was given by the researcher to devising and following interview protocol at different stages of the research process. The researcher prepared a Chinese version of informed consent forms. In seeking the consent of subjects, the interviewer clearly explained the objectives of the research at the beginning of the survey and the interview, and why the subjects had been recruited to participate in the study. The researcher asked the interviewees whether they fully understood the requirement for informed consent, and encouraged them to ask questions when they did not appear to comprehend. Specifically, to assure interviewees that information sought from them would not threaten their safety, the researcher would explain to them that the major interest of the study was to learn about their experiences in dealing with underground banks; that their identity information was not needed. In addition, the interviewees were advised that they could decline to answer any questions which made them uneasy, and they had a right to decline participation in the interviews at any point in the interviewing process.

Great care was taken in the handling of data in storage, reporting, and publication to avoid breaching the assurances of confidentiality made to subjects. The general policy guiding interviews was that the researcher should not ask the names, residential addresses, or workplaces of potential interviewees. So there was no list of names. During the interview process, a list of phone numbers of interviewees was needed for the convenience of contact with each interviewee. Each phone number was marked in an anonymous manner, such as, “interviewee 1, 2, 3 ... ”. Upon the completion of each interview, the referenced phone number was permanently deleted from the record. In that way the promise of confidentiality was not violated.

In this research, only the interviewer had access to the list of contact numbers of subjects and the interview notes, and she had sole responsibility for keeping the list and notes in a safe place at all times. When data was entered in computer files and stored on disks, only case numbers were indicated in reference to each subject. During the research process the researcher

130 Appendix: Research Methods

took full responsibility for the safe storage of data files to prevent accidental disclosure of information. In quoting the accounts of subjects in the report, interviewees were given pseudonyms if necessary. Any descriptive accounts linking to possible identification of subjects were altered in the final document.

Data management and analysis

The closed-ended answers to the survey questions were coded by the researcher herself and entered into a computer. The interview questions were first drafted in Chinese. While the data collection was under way, at the end of each interview handwritten interview notes were immediately transcribed into Microsoft Word document files in both Chinese and English. The interview notes were carefully read and cross-checked for any inconsistency in the accounts of the respondents. The data collected from the interviews were organized according to their direct relevance to different concepts or subjects. A list of indices was produced during the data review process, which contained sets of major themes and subthemes. For example, the index constructed with respect to the use of underground banks included: (1) source of the information, and how the decision was made; (2) initial contact with an underground bank; (3) personal impressions of the underground bank or the operator/owner; (4) transaction process; (5) impact of remittances on the life of the respondent’s family; (6) reflections on the experience of using underground banks and comparisons with other remitting methods. Several subtopics were grouped under each heading. The analytic process was broken down into three main stages: data management, descriptive analysis, and explanatory analysis .

1 Introduction

1 .

There is a lack of consensus on the terminology relating to informal financial systems. Often used terms include “informal funds transfer systems,” “alternative remittance systems,” “underground banking,”

“ethnic banking,” and “informal value systems.” A more detailed description of these systems can be found in El Qorchi et al. (2003). Some scholars argue that a distinction should be made between “informal funds transfer systems” (IFTs) and “informal value transfer mechanisms”

(IVTM) as different types of informal remittance system. See El Qorchi et al. (2003), Maimbo (2003) and Passas (2003). Both refer to “mechanism or networks of people facilitating the transfer of funds or value without leaving a trail of entire transactions or taking place outside the traditionally regulated financial channels.” (El Qorchi et al., 2003).

However, IFTs are mainly used for pure monetary value transfer carried out by ethnic businesses. The practice was widespread in sub-continental India and China and now their services are available across the globe.

They are subject to the financial regulations applicable to money services businesses. Examples of IFTs include the hawala system (prevalent in India and the Middle East) and Chinese underground banking systems (“qianzhuang” in Chinese). IVTM refers to the transfer of value in the form of goods, or a combination of goods and money, for their monetary value. Examples of IVTM are in-kind transfers/payments, invoice manipulation, and trade diversion. They usually have an interface with formal banking institutions, but leave no money trail. See Maimbo and Passas (2004). The term IFT is used in this study to stand for Chinese-operated informal remittance transfer systems.

2 Chinese Underground Banks in China and the

Overseas Operation in the United States

1 .

The analysis in Chapter 4 is suggestive of the importance of dialect-specific networks in cultivating high levels of trust between underground bank operators and clients. Hence a non-Fujianese potential client tends to be viewed as a suspicious “intruder,” who normally would not even obtain access to information like the location of an underground bank without the assistance of a Fujianese-dialect speaker.

2 .

These were officially referred to as “Foreign Exchange Transaction Centers”

(FETCs) in 1980 and were intended for domestic firms to trade their surplus 138

Notes 139

foreign currency for Chinese currency (Lardy, 1992). Swap centers nationwide were opened to foreign investment firms for balancing their foreign exchange in 1986, and opened to individual Chinese nationals for limited purposes (Drumm, 1995; Zhang & Chin, 2002). By 1993, 80 percent of legal foreign exchange transactions were carried out through the swap centers at a more favorable rate than the prevailing official rate (Lardy, 2003).

3 .

Current account and capital account are the two basic components of international transactions subject to control under China’s foreign exchange regulatory regime. Current account transactions consist of international purchases and sales of goods and services, while capital account transactions include securities investment, foreign currency borrowing, and foreign direct investment.

5 .

The private sector accounted for total industrial output worth $1,200

billion in 1999, while the state sector produced around $400 billion.

Over the period between 1996 and 2002 the private sector’s growth rate reached 14.3 percent annually compared with 5.4 percent for the state sector. The private sector has created more jobs for the nonagricultural population than the state sector. During the period from 1995 to 2002, over 70 percent of nonagricultural employees worked in the private sector. By 2005, a total of 29.3 million private sector workers contributed to 49.7 percent of GDP. See Allen et al. (2005) and OECD report (2005).

6 .

As of mid-2006, bank credit allocated to the private sector by state banks accounted for less than 1 percent of all working capital loans, a disproportionately low figure in the light of the contribution the private sector had made to the growth of industry output and employment. See Tsai (2006). During the reform era the private sector not only has been placed at a disadvantage in terms of state policy, legal protection, and administrative management, but also has been subject to restrictions in the allocation of formal financing resources relative to the state sector (Allen et al., 2005).

7 .

The “Big Four” state-owned banks are the Bank of China (BOC), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Construction Bank of China (CBC), and the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC). There is only one state-recognized private bank, Minsheng Bank. Strictly speaking, this bank is not privately owned by Western standards, because its 50 or so shareholders are state-owned corporations. See Garnaut et al. (2001).

8 .

The lending practices of the banking sector in China, particularly the regional branches of the state banks, are subject to the influence of local government. They are required to serve as a policy instrument to promote local development. “Policy” loans include “loans to finance infrastructure investment, fixed investment and working capital of the SOEs, sectorial or regional development assistance, and credit for

140 Notes

procurement of key agricultural products and for mandatory imports.

They also include loans to finance such programs as poverty alleviation in minority areas, education and housing, and ... financial support of insolvent SOEs ... ” (Wolf et al., 2003, p. 126).

According to an anonymous Chinese scholar, underground banks are just one of the eight types of private financing institution in China.

Most of them are illegal in China. See Wang and Yongsheng, “Shangye yinhang he quanzhang qinmi jiechu” [Commercial banks are entering into close contact with securities companies] from Zhongguo zhengquan bao [China Securities News], August 15, 2001, reprinted on DRCNet at

www.drcnet.com.cn . Kelly Tsai, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University, gives a long list of informal financing practices used by Chinese private entrepreneurs. A table containing a range of fund-raising strategies can be found in her “Back-alley banking: Private entrepreneurs in China” (2002), p. 38.

10 .

Some scholars have claimed that lineage systems suffered a breakdown during the land reform and political upheaval that followed the commu-nist takeover in 1949, and were unlikely to be influential after decades of drastic social and economic changes (Potter, 1970, p. 130; Yang, 1959).

Others have argued the opposite: that South China experienced lineage revival in the post-reform era (Johnson, 1993). Peng (2004) found that kinship networks in Chinese villages worked effectively to promote rural private enterprises in the early years of reform, when property rights were not secured and market institutions were not well developed.

11 .

The new generation of Chinese immigrants was no longer restricted to Cantonese-speakers originating from mainland China. They came from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and different countries of Southeast Asia.

12 .

The primary purpose of IRCA was to curtail the employment of illegal aliens in the U.S. The law had two policy components: an amnesty provision which granted certain illegal aliens legal status, and employer sanctions under which penalties were imposed on employers who knowingly hired illegal aliens.

13 .

The 1982 survey of minority-owned business enterprises (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1982) indicated that the largest proportion of Chinese-owned firms was located in urban districts of NYC. According to the 1988 Chinese Business Directory for metropolitan New York, 59 percent of Chinese firms (out of the total of 5,978 entries) and two-thirds of Chinese restaurants (out of a total of 781) were located in Manhattan’s Chinatown and Flushing. Census data from 1990 show that 48.4 percent of the Chinese residing in NYC were clustered in ethnic neighborhoods in the center of the city. This choice of residence tends to be made out of necessity among Chinese immigrants with poor language ability and little knowledge about mainstream society: they need a location near their work places. See Zhou and Logan (1989).

14 .

Enclave economy theory is propounded to explain this phenomenon and to supplement the segmented labor market theory. See Piore (1979),

Notes 141

Wilsons and Portes (1980), Portes and Bach (1985), Bailey and Waldinger (1991), Jiobu (1988), Wilson and Martin (1982), Zhou and Logan (1989).

15 .

This information was obtained from personal interviews with the pastor of the largest Fujianese Christian Church in Chinatown, NYC, in fall 2006. The name of the church means “Grace with Fujian,” and the church claims to have approximately 2,000 members living in NYC, and around 7,000 if those former members scattered around the U.S. are included in the estimate.

3 Main Clientele and Operators of Underground Banks: Analysis and Findings

1 .

Chinese underground banks were declared illegal institutions in China by an ordinance (“Regulations Concerning Outlawing Illegal Financial Institutions and Illegal Financial Services”) issued by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China on June 30, 1998.

2 .

The term “ fei-chi’en ,” (flying money) widely used in literature on Chinese informal fund transfer systems (e.g. Cassidy, 1990; Passas, 2003), was never alluded to by the respondents. It should be also noted that Fujianese immigrants also use “ qianzhuang ” to refer to another informal financial institution popular among them which actually is a type of rotating credit association. These are also known among Fujianese immigrants as

“ biaohui ” (Chinese for rotating credit associations).

3 .

According to the

Balance of Payments Statistical Yearbook prepared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), overseas remittances are classified into three types: (1) Worker remittances, or the value of monetary transfers sent home from workers abroad for more than one year; (2) Compensation of employees (previously labor income), the gross earnings of foreigners residing abroad for less than a year, including the value of in-kind benefits such as housing and payroll taxes; (3) Migrant transfers, the net worth of migrants who move from one country to another (IMF, as cited in Taylor, 1999). The findings from this research show that only the first category is applicable to remittances of Fujianese respondents. For the purposes of this research, the remittances under discussion are limited to cash remittances, thus do not include remittances in kind or in the form of commodities.

4 .

The researcher noted that Fujianese illegal immigrants normally address themselves as “Fuzhounese,” since they come from the rural counties under the jurisdiction of Greater Fuzhou Prefecture. Fuzhou, is the capital city of Fujian Province. “Fujianese” and “Fuzhounese” are used interchangeably in other places in the following chapters.

5 .

According to a news report (LII, 1996), a new passport issued to an illegal immigrant in this way was treated as a replacement of the original passport. The problem is, the Public Security Bureau (the name of the Chinese police) in Fuzhou, the original authority for issuing

142 Notes

passports, did not hold documentation indicating that the original number existed, because the applicant had left China and entered the U.S. illegally. As a result, the applicant risked arrest in China on the charge of possessing a counterfeit passport if he or she tried to return home with it.

6 .

Changle is the leading sending community of undocumented Fujianese migrant workers to the U.S., European Union, and other industrialized nations (Chin, 1999).

7 .

This bank was acquired by Cathay Bank in 2006.

8 .

The Bank of China in Chinatown, NYC, is a branch of China’s state-controlled central foreign exchange bank, and one of the four largest state-owned banks, with its headquarters in Beijing.

9 .

The names of the respondents used in this book are fictitious in order to ensure confidentiality and the anonymity of the research subjects.

10 .

The official foreign exchange rate underwent constant adjustment from in the mid-1980s. The rate was set at RMB4.7 per dollar in 1989, RMB5.8 per dollar from 1990 to 1993, and RMB8.7 in 1994, and then fluctuated around RMB8.3 from 1995 to 2005. See Goldstein and Lardy (2009).

11 .

In comparison with the average costs of remitting money to other countries through legal channels, Chinese-operated money transfer businesses charged significantly lower fees, i.e. an average 2 percent of the principal value. According to research on migrant workers’ remittances (Orozco, 2003), the average transaction cost for bank transfers (including from banks in Europe) to non-Latin American countries was 7 percent for sending US$200, while the fee is 12 percent for firms like Western Union. Average charges for sending $200 through banks in the U.S. to Latin America were in the range of 6–12 percent.

12 .

The respondents normally mentioned that the qianzhuangs they visited were located somewhere near the “Fuzhou Town” area. Many of them either could not remember or were unwilling to tell the researcher the exact location of the qianzhuang . Thus, it is difficult to know whether these respondents had ever used the same qianzhuang , with a few exceptions.

13 .

The decision to use the year 1995 as the demarcating year was relatively tentative, but was made through reasonable deduction. When the researcher checked the narratives of the respondents against one other, a noticeable pattern was identified that the clients who used underground banks before 1995 were able to present information about underground banks in much greater details than those using the informal channels after 1995, with respect to the location, the transaction process, and the background of the operators. However, the researcher recognizes the limitations that come with a much smaller portion of post-1995

users patronizing underground banks in this research (approximately 20 percent as opposed to 80 percent pre-1995 users).

14 .

A couple of the respondents claimed that they used Sister Ping’s qianzhuang in 1994.

Notes 143

15 .

According to the reports on the court trial in June 2005, several gangsters, who were the prosecutor’s witnesses, admitted to using Sister Ping’s qianzhuang for transferring criminal proceeds back to China and other places outside China. See http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2005-/15

/content_3086762.htm .

16 .

This refers to a New York street gang whose members primarily consisted of illegal immigrants from Fujian Province. It was reported to be active on the streets of NYC in the early 1990s, and link to alien smuggling as enforcers working for smuggling groups for purposes of debt collecting and arranging transportation of human cargos. It has since disbanded due to the crackdown by the U.S. government (Chin, 2000).

17 .

According to the respondents, in those early years it was not uncommon among Fujianese migrant workers to carry large amounts of cash around with them, because they could not leave the money at their apartment shared with seven or eight other immigrants due to the high mobility rate of co-tenants.

18 .

According to this respondent, the transactions were carried out near this operator’s residence, in University City in West Philadelphia.

4 Mechanism, Purposes, and Role of Underground Banks in the Smuggling of Chinese

1 .

Chinese term for kinship relations, clanship, or lineage groups. See Peng (2004), p. 1048.

2 .

“ Guanxi ” is the Chinese term referring to interpersonal relations or social networks and “is a synonym for special favors and obligations.” See Peng (2004), p. 135.

3 .

For example, in 1994, the U.S. Congress passed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. In 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act was signed into law, which stiffened penalties for illegal entry, made human smuggling a federal crime, and authorized enhanced undercover investigation.

4 .

The year 1993 is generally considered the landmark year with regard to Chinese illegal immigration because the “Golden Venture” incident of that year not only brought attention to Fujianese illegal immigration, but also spurred the U.S. government to step up efforts to fight against international human smuggling trade. See Chin (1999).

5 .

The majority of the respondents’ experiences showed that detainment lasted only one or two days, which they did not think was worthy of a complaint. Only one respondent admitted that he had been held there for two weeks before payment was settled, but he declined to comment on how he was treated.

6 .

The socio-economic status of each respondent’s household was estimated in several ways. The respondent’s own opinion was solicited by asking the following question: “What did you think of the status of

144 Notes

your family at the time of your departure?” The respondent then would choose among three categories: high, medium, and low income level.

The assessment was also based on a composite measure consisting of the respondent’s occupation, annual income, housing conditions, and the luxury goods owned by the household at the time the respondent left for the U.S. These items are included in the interview and survey questions.

7 .

Western Union’s marketing strategies targeting immigrants have raised concerns. Mr. Tancredo, a Republican Congressman charged that “the company’s activities occupied ‘a gray area’ between aggressive marketing and ‘aiding and abetting illegal immigration.’” Mr. Goddard, Arizona General Attorney, a Democrat, accused Western Union in a lawsuit concerning increased scrutiny of transfers from across the U.S. to a city in Mexico for “protecting an illegal enterprise in human smuggling.”

The court ruled in favor of Western Union. See DeParle (2007).

8 .

Restrictive immigration policies include intensified border controls, simplified deportation procedures, strict asylum policies, and the reinforcement of employer sanctions in receiving countries.

9 .

Migration pressures cover a wide range of factors, including depressed economy, domestic supply for labor in excess of demand, and political disturbance in sending countries, etc.

10 .

See the section under the title “Impact of remittances sent through underground banks on emigrant families and home communities.”

11 .

Nine of the respondents reported that they helped finance their spouse or sibling to enter the U.S. through human smuggling. And the transfer of the portion of the passage fee paid to smugglers and the debt repayment were assisted through qianzhuangs in the Chinatowns in NYC and Philadelphia.

5 Evolution of Underground Banks

1 .

A recent report on the trafficking of Chinese teenagers (of whom a significant proportion come from Fujian Province) into Britain for sex exploitation provides an illustration of this symbiotic relationship involving the activities of illegal enterprise enmeshed within the context of legitimate businesses. The report indicated that a Chinese restaurant in north London was found to serve as way station for more than a hundred smuggled Chinese minors in 2000 before they disappeared. British police discovered in 2007 that one bank account of a Chinese restaurant was used to funnel £93 million back to China, which was suspected to be the proceeds stemming from human trafficking and brothel-keeping (Scott-Clark & Levy, 2008).

2 .

The recommendation prescribes that “each country should take measures to ensure that persons or legal entities, including agents that provide a service for the transmission of money or value, including transmission through an informal money or value transfer system or network, should

Notes 145

be licensed or registered and subject to all the FATF’s recommendations that apply to banks and non-bank financial institutions. Each country should ensure that persons or legal entities that carry out this service illegally are subject to administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions.”

3 .

The recommendation reads that “jurisdictions may consider issuing specific guidance as to what may constitute a suspicious transaction to the MVT service industry. Some currently-used indicators of suspicious financial activity, such as those found in the FATF’s Guidance for Financial Institutions in Detecting Terrorist Financing , are likely to be relevant to money/value transfer service activity. However, particular activities and indicators that are unique to this sector should be further developed.

4 .

MVT service refers to “a financial service that accepts cash, checks, other monetary instruments, or other stores of value in one location and pays a corresponding sum in cash or other form to a beneficiary in another location by means of a communication, message, [or] transfer or through a clearing network to which the MVT service belongs. Transactions performed by such services can involve one or more intermediaries and a third party final payment.”

5 .

See Note 1, Chapter 3 .

Appendix: Research Method

1 .

This term used by Fujianese immigrants means “traditional” or “conserv-ative” when taken at face value. But the researcher was greatly puzzled when she heard it used with such high frequency, and she suspected that it had a different semantic meaning among Fuzhounese dialect speakers, such as: “We Fuzhounese don’t like to open up to an outsider.” The Fujianese-speaking recruiters agreed with the researcher’s conclusion.

2 .

Sometimes the researcher needed to drive to a dangerous neighborhood to conduct an interview at an interviewee’s workplace. The researcher was told by the interviewees that fierce competition in the restaurant business compels Fujianese immigrants to open take-out restaurants in

“frontier” areas, i.e. dangerous urban neighborhoods serving primarily American minority customers.

3 .

These studies include research on a teenage drug ring, underground banks in India, and organized crime in Mexico. See Gomez-Cespedes (1999), Sharma (2006), and Williams (1989).
