<p id="calibre_link-848" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-849">Let us follow the logic of things from the beginning. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-850">Or, rather, from the end: modern times. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-851">We are, as I am writing these lines, witnessing a complete riot against some class of experts, in domains that are too difficult for us to understand, such as macroeconomic reality, and in which not only is the expert not an expert, but he doesn't know it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-852">That previous Federal Reserve bosses Greenspan and Bernanke, had little grasp of empirical reality is something we only discovered too late: one can macroBS longer than microBS, which is why we need to be careful of whom to endow with centralized macro decisions.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-853" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-854">What makes it worse is that all central banks operated under the same model, making it a perfect monoculture.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-855" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-856">In complex domains, expertise doesn't concentrate: under organic reality, things work in a distributed way, as F. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-857">A. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-858">Hayek has convincingly demonstrated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-859">But Hayek used the notion of distributed knowledge. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-860">Well, it looks like we do not even need the “knowledge” part for things to work well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-861">Nor do we need individual rationality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-862">All we need is structure.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-863" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-864">It doesn't mean all participants have</span><span type="pagebreak" title="xiv" id="calibre_link-576" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-865"> a democratic share in decisions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-866">One motivated participant can disproportionately move the needle (what I have studied as the asymmetry of the minority rule). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-867">But every participant has the option to be that player.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-868" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-869">Somehow, under scale transformation, a miraculous effect emerges: rational markets do not require any individual trader to be rational. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-870">In fact they work well under zero intelligence&mdash;a zero‐intelligence crowd, under the right design, works better than a Soviet‐style management composed of maximally intelligent humans.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-871" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-872">Which is why Bitcoin is an excellent idea. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-873">It fulfills the needs of the complex system, not because it is a cryptocurrency, but precisely because it has no owner, no authority that can decide on its fate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-874">It is owned by the crowd, its users. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-875">And it now has a track record of several years, enough for it to be an animal in its own right.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-876" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-877">For other cryptocurrencies to compete, they need to have such a Hayekian property.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-878" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-879">Bitcoin is a currency without a government. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-880">But, one may ask, didn't we have gold, silver, and other metals, another class of currencies without a government? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-881">Not quite. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-882">When you trade gold, you trade “loco” Hong Kong and end up receiving a claim on a stock there, which you might need to move to New Jersey. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-883">Banks control the custodian game and governments control banks (or, rather, bankers and government officials are, to be polite, tight together). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-884">So Bitcoin has a huge advantage over gold in transactions: clearance does not require a specific custodian. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-885">No government can control what code you have in your head.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-886" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-887">Finally, Bitcoin will go through hiccups. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-888">It may fail; but then it will be easily reinvented as we now know how it works. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-889">In its present state, it may not be convenient for transactions, not good enough to buy your decaffeinated espresso macchiato at your local virtue‐signaling coffee chain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-890">It may be too volatile to be a currency for now. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-891">But it is the first organic currency.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-892" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-893">But its mere existence is an insurance policy that will remind governments that the last object the establishment could control, namely, the currency, is no longer their monopoly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-894">This gives us, the crowd, an insurance policy against an Orwellian future.</span></p>

<section class="calibre2"><span id="calibre_link-899" class="calibre"></span>
<p id="calibre_link-900" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-901">On November 1, 2008, a computer programmer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto sent an email to a cryptography mailing list to announce that he had produced a “new electronic cash system that's fully peer‐to‐peer, with no trusted third party.”</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-5" href="#calibre_link-1" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-902">1</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-903"> He copied the abstract of the paper explaining the design, and a link to it online. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-904">In essence, Bitcoin offered a payment network with its own native currency, and used a sophisticated method for members to verify all transactions without having to trust in any single member of the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-905">The currency was issued at a predetermined rate to reward the members who spent their processing power on verifying the transactions, thus providing a reward for their work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-906">The startling thing about this invention was that, contrary to many other previous attempts at setting up a digital cash, it actually worked.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-907" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-908">While a clever and neat design, there wasn't much to suggest that such a quirky experiment would interest anyone outside the circles of cryptography geeks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-909">For months this was the case, as barely a few dozen users worldwide were joining the network and engaging in mining and sending each other coins that began to acquire</span><span type="pagebreak" title="xvi" id="calibre_link-578" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-910"> the status of collectibles, albeit in digital form.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-911" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-912">But in October 2009, an Internet exchange</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-6" href="#calibre_link-2" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-913">2</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-914"> sold 5,050 bitcoins for $5.02, at a price of $1 for 1,006 bitcoins, to register the first purchase of a bitcoin with money.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-7" href="#calibre_link-3" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-915">3</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-916"> The price was calculated by measuring the value of the electricity needed to produce a bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-917">In economic terms, this seminal moment was arguably the most significant in Bitcoin's life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-918">Bitcoin was no longer just a digital game being played within a fringe community of programmers; it had now become a market good with a price, indicating that someone somewhere had developed a positive valuation for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-919">On May 22, 2010, someone else paid 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizza pies worth $25, representing the first time that bitcoin was used as a medium of exchange. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-920">The token had needed seven months to transition from being a market good to being a medium of exchange.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-921" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-922">Since then, the Bitcoin network has grown in the number of users and transactions, and the processing power dedicated to it, while the value of its currency has risen quickly, exceeding $7,000 per bitcoin as of November 2017.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-8" href="#calibre_link-4" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-923">4</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-924"> After eight years, it is clear that this invention is no longer just an online game, but a technology that has passed the market test and is being used by many for real‐world purposes, with its exchange rate being regularly featured on TV, in newspapers, and on websites along with the exchange rates of national currencies.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-925" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-926">Bitcoin can be best understood as distributed software that allows for transfer of value using a currency protected from unexpected inflation without relying on trusted third parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-927">In other words, Bitcoin automates the functions of a modern central bank and makes them predictable and virtually immutable by programming them into code decentralized among thousands of network members, none of whom can alter the code without the consent of the rest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-928">This makes Bitcoin the first demonstrably reliable operational example of </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-929">digital cash</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-930"> and </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-931">digital hard money</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-932">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-933">While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problems it purports to solve&mdash;namely, providing a form of money that is under the full command of its owner and likely</span><span type="pagebreak" title="xvii" id="calibre_link-579" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-934"> to hold its value in the long run&mdash;are as old as human society itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-935">This book presents a conception of these problems based on years of studying this technology and the economic problems it solves, and how societies have previously found solutions for them throughout history. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-936">My conclusion may surprise those who label Bitcoin a scam or ruse of speculators and promoters out to make a quick buck. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-937">Indeed, Bitcoin improves on earlier “store of value” solutions, and Bitcoin's suitability as the sound money of a digital age may catch naysayers by surprise.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-938" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-939">History can foreshadow what's to come, particularly when examined closely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-940">And time will tell just how sound the case made in this book is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-941">As it must, the first part of the book explains money, its function and properties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-942">As an economist with an engineering background, I have always sought to understand a technology in terms of the problems it purports to solve, which allows for the identification of its functional essence and its separation from incidental, cosmetic, and insignificant characteristics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-943">By understanding the problems money attempts to solve, it becomes possible to elucidate what makes for sound and unsound money, and to apply that conceptual framework to understand how and why various goods, such as seashells, beads, metals, and government money, have served the function of money, and how and why they may have failed at it or served society's purposes to store value and exchange it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-944" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-945">The second part of the book discusses the individual, social, and global implications of sound and unsound forms of money throughout history. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-946">Sound money allows people to think about the long term and to save and invest more for the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-947">Saving and investing for the long run are the key to capital accumulation and the advance of human civilization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-948">Money is the information and measurement system of an economy, and sound money is what allows trade, investment, and entrepreneurship to proceed on a solid basis, whereas unsound money throws these processes into disarray. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-949">Sound money is also an essential element of a free society as it provides for an effective bulwark against despotic government.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-950" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-951">The third section of the book explains the operation of the Bitcoin network and its most salient economic characteristics, and analyzes the possible uses of Bitcoin as a form of sound money, discussing some use cases which Bitcoin does not serve well, as well</span><span type="pagebreak" title="xviii" id="calibre_link-580" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-952"> as addressing some of the most common misunderstandings and misconceptions surrounding it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-953" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-954">This book is written to help the reader understand the economics of Bitcoin and how it serves as the digital iteration of the many technologies used to fulfill the functions of money throughout history. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-955">This book is not an advertisement or invitation to buy into the bitcoin currency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-956">Far from it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-957">The value of bitcoin is likely to remain volatile, at least for a while; the Bitcoin network may yet succeed or fail, for whatever foreseeable or unforeseeable reasons; and using it requires technical competence and carries risks that make it unsuited for many people. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-958">This book does not offer investment advice, but aims at helping elucidate the economic properties of the network and its operation, to allow readers an informed understanding before deciding whether they want to use it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-959" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-960">Only with such an understanding, and only after extensive and thorough research into the practical operational aspects of owning and storing bitcoins, should anyone consider holding value in Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-961">While bitcoin's rise in market value may make it appear like a no‐brainer as an investment, a closer look at the myriad hacks, attacks, scams, and security failures that have cost people their bitcoins provides a sobering warning to anyone who thinks that owning bitcoins provides a guaranteed profit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-962">Should you come out of reading this book thinking that the bitcoin currency is something worth owning, your first investment should not be in buying bitcoins, but in time spent understanding how to buy, store, and own bitcoins securely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-963">It is the inherent nature of Bitcoin that such knowledge cannot be delegated or outsourced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-964">There is no alternative to personal responsibility for anyone interested in using this network, and that is the real investment that needs to be made to get into Bitcoin.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-981" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-982">Bitcoin is the newest technology to serve the function of money&mdash;an invention leveraging the technological possibilities of the digital age to solve a problem that has persisted for all of humanity's existence: how to move economic value across time and space. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-983">In order to understand Bitcoin, one must first understand money, and to understand money, there is no alternative to the study of the function and history of money.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-984" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-985">The simplest way for people to exchange value is to exchange valuable goods with one another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-986">This process of </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-987">direct exchange</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-988"> is referred to as barter, but is only practical in small circles with only a few goods and services produced. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-989">In a hypothetical economy of a dozen people isolated from the world, there is not much scope for specialization and trade, and it would be possible for individuals to each engage in the production of the most basic essentials of survival and exchange them among themselves directly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-990">Barter has always existed in human society and continues to this day, but it is highly impractical and remains only in use in exceptional circumstances, usually</span><span type="pagebreak" title="2" id="calibre_link-220" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-991"> involving people with extensive familiarity with one another.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-992" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-993">In a more sophisticated and larger economy, the opportunity arises for individuals to specialize in the production of more goods and to exchange them with many more people&mdash;people with whom they have no personal relationships, strangers with whom it is utterly impractical to keep a running tally of goods, services, and favors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-994">The larger the market, the more the opportunities for specialization and exchange, but also the bigger the problem of </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-995">coincidence of wants</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-996">&mdash;what you want to acquire is produced by someone who doesn't want what you have to sell. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-997">The problem is deeper than different requirements for different goods, as there are three distinct dimensions to the problem.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-998" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-999">First, there is the lack of coincidence in scales: what you want may not be equal in value to what you have and dividing one of them into smaller units may not be practical. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1000">Imagine wanting to sell shoes for a house; you cannot buy the house in small pieces each equivalent in value to a pair of shoes, nor does the homeowner want to own all the shoes whose value is equivalent to that of the house. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1001">Second, there is the lack of coincidence in time frames: what you want to sell may be perishable but what you want to buy is more durable and valuable, making it hard to accumulate enough of your perishable good to exchange for the durable good at one point in time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1002">It is not easy to accumulate enough apples to be exchanged for a car at once, because they will rot before the deal can be completed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1003">Third, there is the lack of coincidence of locations: you may want to sell a house in one place to buy a house in another location, and (most) houses aren't transportable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1004">These three problems make direct exchange highly impractical and result in people needing to resort to performing more layers of exchange to satisfy their economic needs.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1005" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1006">The only way around this is through </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1007">indirect exchange</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1008">: you try to find some other good that another person would want and find someone who will exchange it with you for what you want to sell. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1009">That intermediary good is a </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1010">medium of exchange</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1011">, and while any good could serve as the medium of exchange, as the scope and size of the economy grows it becomes impractical for people to constantly search for different goods that their counterparty is looking for, carrying out several exchanges for each exchange they want to conduct. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1012">A far more efficient solution will naturally emerge, if only because those</span><span type="pagebreak" title="3" id="calibre_link-178" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1013"> who chance upon it will be far more productive than those who do not: a single medium of exchange (or at most a small number of media of exchange) emerges for everyone to trade their goods for. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1014">A good that assumes the role of a widely accepted medium of exchange is called money.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1015" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1016">Being a medium of exchange is the quintessential function that defines money&mdash;in other words, it is a good purchased not to be consumed (a consumption good), nor to be employed in the production of other goods (an investment, or capital good), but primarily for the sake of being exchanged for other goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1017">While investment is also meant to produce income to be exchanged for other goods, it is distinct from money in three respects: first, it offers a return, which money does not offer; second, it always involves a risk of failure, whereas money is supposed to carry the least risk; third, investments are less liquid than money, necessitating significant transaction costs every time they are to be spent. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1018">This can help us understand why there will always be demand for money, and why holding investments can never entirely replace money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1019">Human life is lived with uncertainty as a given, and humans cannot know for sure when they will need what amount of money.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-365" href="#calibre_link-361" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1020">1</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1021"> It is common sense, and age‐old wisdom in virtually all human cultures, for individuals to want to store some portion of their wealth in the form of money, because it is the most liquid holding possible, allowing the holder to quickly liquidate if she needs to, and because it involves less risk than any investment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1022">The price for the convenience of holding money comes in the form of the forgone consumption that could have been had with it, and in the form of the forgone returns that could have been made from investing it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1023" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1024">From examining such human choices in market situations, Carl Menger, the father of the Austrian school of economics and founder of marginal analysis in economics, came up with an understanding of the key property that leads to a good being adopted freely as money on the market, and that is </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1025">salability</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1026">&mdash;the ease with which a good can be sold on the market whenever its holder</span><span type="pagebreak" title="4" id="calibre_link-353" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1027"> desires, with the least loss in its price.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-366" href="#calibre_link-362" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1028">2</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1029" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1030">There is nothing in principle that stipulates what should or should not be used as money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1031">Any person choosing to purchase something not for its own sake, but with the aim of exchanging it for something else, is making it de facto money, and as people vary, so do their opinions on, and choices of, what constitutes money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1032">Throughout human history, many things have served the function of money: gold and silver, most notably, but also copper, seashells, large stones, salt, cattle, government paper, precious stones, and even alcohol and cigarettes in certain conditions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1033">People's choices are subjective, and so there is no “right” and “wrong” choice of money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1034">There are, however, consequences to choices.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1035" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1036">The relative salability of goods can be assessed in terms of how well they address the three facets of the problem of the lack of coincidence of wants mentioned earlier: their salability across scales, across space, and across time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1037">A good that is salable across scales can be conveniently divided into smaller units or grouped into larger units, thus allowing the holder to sell it in whichever quantity he desires. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1038">Salability across space indicates an ease of transporting the good or carrying it along as a person travels, and this has led to good monetary media generally having high value per unit of weight. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1039">Both of these characteristics are not very hard to fulfill by a large number of goods that could potentially serve the function of money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1040">It is the third element, salability across time, which is the most crucial.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1041" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1042">A good's salability across time refers to its ability to hold value into the future, allowing the holder to store wealth in it, which is the second function of money: </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1043">store of value</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1044">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1045">For a good to be salable across time it has to be immune to rot, corrosion, and other types of deterioration. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1046">It is safe to say anyone who thought he could store his wealth for the long term in fish, apples, or oranges learned the lesson the hard way, and likely had very little reason to worry about storing wealth for a while. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1047">Physical integrity through time, however, is a necessary but insufficient condition for salability across time, as it is possible for a good to lose its value significantly even if its physical condition remains unchanged. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1048">For the good to maintain its value, it</span><span type="pagebreak" title="5" id="calibre_link-245" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1049"> is also necessary that the supply of the good not increase too drastically during the period during which the holder owns it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1050">A common characteristic of forms of money throughout history is the presence of some mechanism to restrain the production of new units of the good to maintain the value of the existing units. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1051">The relative difficulty of producing new monetary units determines the hardness of money: money whose supply is hard to increase is known as </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1052">hard money</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1053">, while </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1054">easy money</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1055"> is money whose supply is amenable to large increases.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1056" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1057">We can understand money's hardness through understanding two distinct quantities related to the supply of a good: (1) the </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1058">stock</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1059">, which is its existing supply, consisting of everything that has been produced in the past, minus everything that has been consumed or destroyed; and (2) the </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1060">flow</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1061">, which is the extra production that will be made in the next time period. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1062">The ratio between the stock and flow is a reliable indicator of a good's hardness as money, and how well it is suited to playing a monetary role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1063">A good that has a low ratio of stock‐to‐flow is one whose existing supply can be increased drastically if people start using it as a store of value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1064">Such a good would be unlikely to maintain value if chosen as a store of value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1065">The higher the ratio of the stock to the flow, the more likely a good is to maintain its value over time and thus be more salable across time.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-367" href="#calibre_link-363" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1066">3</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1067" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1068">If people choose a hard money, with a high stock‐to‐flow ratio, as a store of value, their purchasing of it to store it would increase demand for it, causing a rise in its price, which would incentivize its producers to make more of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1069">But because the flow is small compared to the existing supply, even a large increase in the new production is unlikely to depress the price significantly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1070">On the other hand, if people chose to store their wealth in an easy money, with a low stock‐to‐flow ratio, it would be trivial for the producers of this good to create very large quantities of it that depress the price, devaluing the good, expropriating the wealth of the savers, and destroying the good's salability across time.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1071" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1072">I like to call this the </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1073">easy money trap</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1074">: anything used as a store of value will have its supply increased, and anything whose supply can be easily increased will destroy the wealth of those</span><span type="pagebreak" title="6" id="calibre_link-352" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1075"> who used it as a store of value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1076">The corollary to this trap is that anything that is successfully used as money will have some natural or artificial mechanism that restricts the new flow of the good into the market, maintaining its value across time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1077">It therefore follows that for something to assume a monetary role, it has to be costly to produce, otherwise the temptation to make money on the cheap will destroy the wealth of the savers, and destroy the incentive anyone has to save in this medium.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1078" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1079">Whenever a natural, technological, or political development resulted in quickly increasing the new supply of a monetary good, the good would lose its monetary status and be replaced by other media of exchange with a more reliably high stock‐to‐flow ratio, as will be discussed in the next chapter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1080">Seashells were used as money when they were hard to find, loose cigarettes are used as money in prisons because they are hard to procure or produce, and with national currencies, the lower the rate of increase of the supply, the more likely the currency is to be held by individuals and maintain its value over time.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1081" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1082">When modern technology made the importation and catching of seashells easy, societies that used them switched to metal or paper money, and when a government increases its currency's supply, its citizens shift to holding foreign currencies, gold, or other more reliable monetary assets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1083">The twentieth century provided us an unfortunately enormous number of such tragic examples, particularly from developing countries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1084">The monetary media that survived for longest are the ones that had very reliable mechanisms for restricting their supply growth&mdash;in other words, </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1085">hard money</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1086">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1087">Competition is at all times alive between monetary media, and its outcomes are foretold through the effects of technology on the differing stock‐to‐flow ratio of the competitors, as will be demonstrated in the next chapter.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1088" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1089">While people are generally free to use whichever goods they please as their media of exchange, the reality is that over time, the ones who use hard money will benefit most, by losing very little value due to the negligible new supply of their medium of exchange. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1090">Those who choose easy money will likely lose value as its supply grows quickly, bringing its market price down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1091">Whether through prospective rational calculation, or the retrospective harsh lessons of reality, the majority of money and wealth will be concentrated with those who choose the hardest and most salable forms of money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1092">But the hardness</span><span type="pagebreak" title="7" id="calibre_link-344" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1093"> and salability of goods itself is not something that is static in time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1094">As the technological capabilities of different societies and eras have varied, so has the hardness of various forms of money, and with it their salability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1095">In reality, the choice of what makes the best money has always been determined by the technological realities of societies shaping the salability of different goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1096">Hence, Austrian economists are rarely dogmatic or objectivist in their definition of sound money, defining it not as a specific good or commodity, but as whichever money emerges freely chosen on the market by the people who transact with it, not imposed on them by coercive authority, and money whose value is determined through market interaction, and not through government imposition.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-368" href="#calibre_link-364" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1097">4</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1098"> Free‐market monetary competition is ruthlessly effective at producing sound money, as it only allows those who choose the right money to maintain considerable wealth over time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1099">There is no need for government to impose the hardest money on society; society will have uncovered it long before it concocted its government, and any governmental imposition, if it were to have any effect, would only serve to hinder the process of monetary competition.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1100" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1101">The full individual and societal implications of hard and easy money are far more profound than mere financial loss or gain, and are a central theme of this book, discussed thoroughly in </span><a href="#calibre_link-117" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1102">Chapters 5</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1103">, </span><a href="#calibre_link-24" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1104">6</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1105">, and </span><a href="#calibre_link-104" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1106">7</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1107">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1108">Those who are able to save their wealth in a good store of value are likely to plan for the future more than those who have bad stores of value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1109">The soundness of the monetary media, in terms of its ability to hold value over time, is a key determinant of how much individuals value the present over the future, or their </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1110">time preference</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1111">, a pivotal concept in this book.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1112" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1113">Beyond the stock‐to‐flow ratio, another important aspect of a monetary medium's salability is its acceptability by others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1114">The more people accept a monetary medium, the more liquid it is, and the more likely it is to be bought and sold without too much loss. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1115">In social settings with many peer‐to‐peer interactions, as computing protocols demonstrate, it is natural for a few standards to emerge to dominate exchange, because the gains from joining a network grow exponentially the larger the size of the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1116">Hence, Facebook and a handful of social media networks dominate the market, when many hundreds</span><span type="pagebreak" title="8" id="calibre_link-355" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1117"> of almost identical networks were created and promoted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1118">Similarly, any device that sends emails has to utilize the IMAP/POP3 protocol for receiving email, and the SMTP protocol for sending it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1119">Many other protocols were invented, and they could be used perfectly well, but almost nobody uses them because to do so would preclude a user from interacting with almost everyone who uses email today, because they are on IMAP/POP3 and SMTP. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1120">Similarly, with money, it was inevitable that one, or a few, goods would emerge as the main medium of exchange, because the property of being exchanged easily matters the most. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1121">A medium of exchange, as mentioned before, is not acquired for its own properties, but for its salability.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1122" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1123">Further, wide acceptance of a medium of exchange allows all prices to be expressed in its terms, which allows it to play the third function of money: </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1124">unit of account</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1125">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1126">In an economy with no recognized medium of exchange, each good will have to be priced in terms of each other good, leading to a large number of prices, making economic calculations exceedingly difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1127">In an economy with a medium of exchange, all prices of all goods are expressed in terms of the same unit of account. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1128">In this society money serves as a metric with which to measure interpersonal value; it rewards producers to the extent that they contribute value to others, and signifies to consumers how much they need to pay to obtain their desired goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1129">Only with a uniform medium of exchange acting as a unit of account does complex economic calculation become possible, and with it comes the possibility for specialization into complex tasks, capital accumulation, and large markets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1130">The operation of a market economy is dependent on prices, and prices, to be accurate, are dependent on a common medium of exchange, which reflects the relative scarcity of different goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1131">If this is easy money, the ability of its issuer to constantly increase its quantity will prevent it from accurately reflecting opportunity costs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1132">Every unpredictable change in the quantity of money would distort its role as a measure of interpersonal value and a conduit for economic information.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1133" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1134">Having a single medium of exchange allows the size of the economy to grow as large as the number of people willing to use that medium of exchange. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1135">The larger the size of the economy, the larger the opportunities for gains from exchange and specialization, and perhaps more significantly, the longer and more sophisticated the structure of production can become. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1136">Producers can specialize in</span><span type="pagebreak" title="9" id="calibre_link-199" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1137"> producing capital goods that will only produce final consumer goods after longer intervals, which allows for more productive and superior products. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1138">In the primitive small economy, the structure of production of fish consisted of individuals going to the shore and catching fish with their bare hands, with the entire process taking a few hours from start to finish. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1139">As the economy grows, more sophisticated tools and capital goods are utilized, and the production of these tools stretches the duration of the production process significantly while also increasing its productivity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1140">In the modern world, fish are caught with highly sophisticated boats that take years to build and are operated for decades. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1141">These boats are able to sail to seas that smaller boats cannot reach and thus produce fish that would otherwise not be available. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1142">The boats can brave inclement weather and continue production in very difficult conditions where less capital‐intensive boats would be docked uselessly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1143">As capital accumulation has made the process longer, it has become more productive per unit of labor, and it can produce superior products that were never possible for the primitive economy with basic tools and no capital accumulation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1144">None of this would be possible without money playing the roles of medium of exchange to allow specialization; store of value to create future‐orientation and incentivize individuals to direct resources to investment instead of consumption; and unit of account to allow economic calculation of profits and losses.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1145" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1146">The history of money's evolution has seen various goods play the role of money, with varying degrees of hardness and soundness, depending on the technological capabilities of each era. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1147">From seashells to salt, cattle, silver, gold, and gold‐backed government money, ending with the current almost universal use of government‐provided legal tender, every step of technological advance has allowed us to utilize a new form of money with added benefits, but, as always, new pitfalls. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1148">By examining the history of the tools and materials that have been employed in the role of money throughout history, we are able to discern the characteristics that make for good money and the ones that make for bad money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1149">Only with this background in place can we then move on to understand how Bitcoin functions and what its role as a monetary medium is.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-1197" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1198">Of all the historical forms of money I have come across, the one that most resembles the operation of Bitcoin is the ancient system based on Rai stones on Yap Island, today a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1199">Understanding how the large circular stones carved from limestone functioned as money will help us explain Bitcoin's operation in </span><a href="#calibre_link-112" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1200">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1201">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1202">Understanding the remarkable tale of how the Rai stones lost their monetary role is an object lesson in how money loses its monetary status once it loses its hardness.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1203" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1204">The Rai stones that constituted money were of various sizes, rising to large circular disks with a hole in the middle that weighed up to four metric tons. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1205">They were not native to Yap, which did not contain any limestone, and all of Yap's stones were brought in from neighboring Palau or Guam. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1206">The beauty and rarity of these stones made them desirable and venerable in Yap, but procuring them was very difficult as it involved a laborious process of quarrying and then shipping them with rafts and canoes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1207">Some of these rocks required hundreds of people to transport them, and once they arrived on Yap, they were placed in a prominent location where everyone could see</span><span type="pagebreak" title="12" id="calibre_link-320" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1208"> them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1209">The owner of the stone could use it as a payment method without it having to move: all that would happen is that the owner would announce to all townsfolk that the stone's ownership has now moved to the recipient. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1210">The whole town would recognize the ownership of the stone and the recipient could then use it to make a payment whenever he so pleased. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1211">There was effectively no way of stealing the stone because its ownership was known by everybody.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1212" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1213">For centuries, and possibly even millennia, this monetary system worked well for the Yapese. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1214">While the stones never moved, they had salability across space, as one could use them for payment anywhere on the island. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1215">The different sizes of the different stones provided some degree of salability across scales, as did the possibility of paying with fractions of a single stone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1216">The stones' salability across time was assured for centuries by the difficulty and high cost of acquiring new stones, because they didn't exist in Yap and quarrying and shipping them from Palau was not easy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1217">The very high cost of procuring new stones to Yap meant that the existing supply of stones was always far larger than whatever new supply could be produced at a given period of time, making it prudent to accept them as a form of payment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1218">In other words, Rai stones had a very high stock‐to‐flow ratio, and no matter how desirable they were, it was not easy for anyone to inflate the supply of stones by bringing in new rocks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1219">Or, at least, that was the case until 1871, when an Irish‐American captain by the name of David O'Keefe was shipwrecked on the shores of Yap and revived by the locals.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-683" href="#calibre_link-678" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1220">1</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1221" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1222">O'Keefe saw a profit opportunity in taking coconuts from the island and selling them to producers of coconut oil, but he had no means to entice the locals to work for him, because they were very content with their lives as they were, in their tropical paradise, and had no use for whatever foreign forms of money he could offer them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1223">But O'Keefe wouldn't take no for an answer; he sailed to Hong Kong, procured a large boat and explosives, took them to Palau, where he used the explosives and modern tools to quarry several large Rai stones, and set sail to Yap to present the stones to the locals as payment for coconuts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1224">Contrary to what O'Keefe expected, the villagers</span><span type="pagebreak" title="13" id="calibre_link-168" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1225"> were not keen on receiving his stones, and the village chief banned his townsfolk from working for the stones, decreeing that O'Keefe's stones were not of value, because they were gathered too easily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1226">Only the stones quarried traditionally, with the sweat and blood of the Yapese, were to be accepted in Yap. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1227">Others on the island disagreed, and they did supply O'Keefe with the coconuts he sought. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1228">This resulted in conflict on the island, and in time the demise of Rai stones as money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1229">Today, the stones serve a more ceremonial and cultural role on the island and modern government money is the most commonly used monetary medium.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1230" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1231">While O'Keefe's story is highly symbolic, he was but the harbinger of the inevitable demise of Rai stones' monetary role with the encroachment of modern industrial civilization on Yap and its inhabitants. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1232">As modern tools and industrial capabilities reached the region, it was inevitable that the production of the stones would become far less costly than before. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1233">There would be many O'Keefes, local and foreign, able to supply Yap with an ever‐larger flow of new stones. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1234">With modern technology, the stock‐to‐flow ratio for Rai stones decreased drastically: it was possible to produce far more of these stones every year, significantly devaluing the island's existing stock. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1235">It became increasingly unwise for anyone to use these stones as a store of value, and thus they lost their salability across time, and with it, their function as a medium of exchange.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1236" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1237">The details may differ, but the underlying dynamic of a drop in stock‐to‐flow ratio has been the same for every form of money that has lost its monetary role, up to the collapse of the Venezuelan bolivar taking place as these lines are being written.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1238" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1239">A similar story happened with the aggry beads used as money for centuries in western Africa. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1240">The history of these beads in western Africa is not entirely clear, with suggestions that they were made from meteorite stones, or passed on from Egyptian and Phoenician traders. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1241">What is known is that they were precious in an area where glassmaking technology was expensive and not very common, giving them a high stock‐to‐flow ratio, making them salable across time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1242">Being small and valuable, these beads were salable across scale, because they could be combined into chains, necklaces, or bracelets; though this was far from ideal, because there were many different kinds of beads rather than one standard unit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1243">They were also salable across space as they were easy to move around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1244">In contrast, glass</span><span type="pagebreak" title="14" id="calibre_link-342" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1245"> beads were not expensive and had no monetary role in Europe, because the proliferation of glassmaking technology meant that if they were to be utilized as a monetary unit, their producers could flood the market with them&mdash;in other words, they had a low stock‐to‐flow ratio.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1246" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1247">When European explorers and traders visited West Africa in the sixteenth century, they noticed the high value given to these beads and so started importing them in mass quantities from Europe. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1248">What followed was similar to the story of O'Keefe, but given the tiny size of the beads and the much larger size of the population, it was a slower, more covert process with bigger and more tragic consequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1249">Slowly but surely, Europeans were able to purchase a lot of the precious resources of Africa for the beads they acquired back home for very little.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-684" href="#calibre_link-679" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1250">2</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1251"> European incursion into Africa slowly turned beads from hard money to easy money, destroying their salability and causing the erosion of the purchasing power of these beads over time in the hands of the Africans who owned them, impoverishing them by transferring their wealth to the Europeans, who could acquire the beads easily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1252">The aggry beads later came to be known as slave beads for the role they played in fueling the slave trade of Africans to Europeans and North Americans. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1253">A one‐time collapse in the value of a monetary medium is tragic, but at least it is over quickly and its holders can begin trading, saving, and calculating with a new one. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1254">But a slow drain of its monetary value over time will slowly transfer the wealth of its holders to those who can produce the medium at a low cost. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1255">This is a lesson worth remembering when we turn to the discussion of the soundness of government money in the later parts of the book.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-1267" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1268">This was not just the fate of seashell money in North America; whenever societies employing seashells had access to uniform metal coins, they adopted them and benefited from the switch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1269">Also, the arrival of industrial civilization, with fossil‐fuel‐powered boats, made scouring the sea for seashells easier, increasing the flow of their production and dropping the stock‐to‐flow ratio quickly.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1270" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1271">Other ancient forms of money include cattle, cherished for their nutritional value, as they were one of the most prized possessions anyone could own and were also salable across space due to their mobility. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1272">Cattle continue to play a monetary role today, with many societies using them for payments, especially for dowries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1273">Being bulky and not easily divisible, however, meant cattle were not very useful to solve the problems of divisibility across scales, and so another form of money coexisted along with cattle, and that was salt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1274">Salt was easy to keep for long durations and could be easily divided and grouped into whatever weight was necessary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1275">These historical facts are still apparent in the English language, as the word </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1276">pecuniary</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1277"> is derived from </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1278">pecus</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1279">, the Latin word for cattle, while the word </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1280">salary</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1281"> is derived from </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1282">sal</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1283">, the Latin word for salt.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-687" href="#calibre_link-682" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1284">5</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1285" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1286">As technology advanced, particularly</span><span type="pagebreak" title="16" id="calibre_link-583" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1287"> with metallurgy, humans developed superior forms of money to these artifacts, which began to quickly replace them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1288">These metals proved a better medium of exchange than seashells, stones, beads, cattle, and salt because they could be made into uniform, highly valuable small units that could be moved around far more easily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1289">Another nail in the coffin of artifact money came with the mass utilization of hydrocarbon fuel energy, which increased our productive capacity significantly, allowing for a quick increase in the new supply (flow) of these artifacts, meaning that the forms of money that relied on difficulty of production to protect their high stock‐to‐flow ratio lost it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1290">With modern hydrocarbon fuels, Rai stones could be quarried easily, aggry beads could be made for very little cost, and seashells could be collected en masse by large boats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1291">As soon as these monies lost their hardness, their holders suffered significant wealth expropriation and the entire fabric of their society fell apart as a result. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1292">The Yap Island chiefs who refused O'Keefe's cheap Rai stones understood what most modern economists fail to grasp: a money that is easy to produce is no money at all, and easy money does not make a society richer; on the contrary, it makes it poorer by placing all its hard‐earned wealth for sale in exchange for something easy to produce.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-1317" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1318">As human technical capacity for the production of goods became more sophisticated, and our utilization of metals and commodities grew, many metals started getting produced at large enough quantities and were in large enough demand to make them highly salable and suited for being used as monetary media. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1319">These metals' density and relatively high value made moving them around easy, easier than salt or cattle, making them highly salable across space. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1320">The production of metals was initially not easy, making it hard to increase their supply quickly and giving them good salability across time.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1321" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1322">Due to their durability and physical properties, as well as their relative abundance in earth, some metals were more valuable than others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1323">Iron and copper, because of their relatively high abundance and their susceptibility to corrosion, could be produced in increasing quantities. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1324">Existing stockpiles would be dwarfed by new production, destroying the value in them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1325">These metals developed a relatively low market value and would be used for smaller transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1326">Rarer metals such as silver and gold, on the other hand, were more durable and less likely to corrode or ruin, making them more salable across time</span><span type="pagebreak" title="18" id="calibre_link-221" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1327"> and useful as a store of value into the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1328">Gold's virtual indestructibility, in particular, allowed humans to store value across generations, thus allowing us to develop a longer time horizon orientation.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1329" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1330">Initially, metals were bought and sold in terms of their weight,</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-709" href="#calibre_link-688" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1331">1</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1332"> but over time, as metallurgy advanced, it became possible to mint them into uniform coins and brand them with their weight, making them far more salable by saving people from having to weigh and assess the metals every time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1333">The three metals most widely used for this role were gold, silver, and copper, and their use as coins was the prime form of money for around 2,500 years, from the time of the Greek king Croesus, who was the first recorded to have minted gold coins, to the early twentieth century. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1334">Gold coins were the goods most salable across time, because they could hold their value over time and resist decay and ruin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1335">They were also the goods most salable across space, because they carried a lot of value in small weights, allowing for easy transportation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1336">Silver coins, on the other hand, had the advantage of being the most salable good across scales, because their lower value per weight unit compared to gold allowed for them to conveniently serve as a medium of exchange for small transactions, while bronze coins would be useful for the least valuable transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1337">By standardizing values into easily identifiable units, coins allowed for the creation of large markets, increasing the scope of specialization and trade worldwide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1338">While the best monetary system technologically possible at the time, it still had two major drawbacks: the first was that the existence of two or three metals as the monetary standard created economic problems from the fluctuation of their values over time due to the ebbs of supply and demand, and created problems for owners of these coins, particularly silver, which experienced declines in value due to increases in production and drops in demand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1339">The second, more serious flaw was that governments and counterfeiters could, and frequently did, reduce the precious metal content in these coins, causing their value to decline by transferring a fraction of their purchasing power to the counterfeiters or the government. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1340">The reduction in the metal content of the coins compromised the purity and soundness of the money.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1341" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1342">By the nineteenth century, however,</span><span type="pagebreak" title="19" id="calibre_link-262" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1343"> with the development of modern banking and the improvement in methods of communication, individuals could transact with paper money and checks backed by gold in the treasuries of their banks and central banks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1344">This made gold‐backed transactions possible at any scale, thus obviating the need for silver's monetary role, and gathering all essential monetary salability properties in the gold standard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1345">The gold standard allowed for unprecedented global capital accumulation and trade by uniting the majority of the planet's economy on one sound market‐based choice of money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1346">Its tragic flaw, however, was that by centralizing the gold in the vaults of banks, and later central banks, it made it possible for banks and governments to increase the supply of money beyond the quantity of gold they held, devaluing the money and transferring part of its value from the money's legitimate holders to the governments and banks.</span></p></section>

<h2 id="calibre_link-523" class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1348">Why Gold?</span></h2>
<p id="calibre_link-1349" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1350">To understand how commodity money emerges, we return in more detail to the easy money trap we first introduced in </span><a href="#calibre_link-20" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1351">Chapter 1</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1352">, and begin by differentiating between a good's </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1353">market demand</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1354"> (demand for consuming or holding the good for its own sake) and its </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1355">monetary demand</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1356"> (demand for a good as a medium of exchange and store of value). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1357">Any time a person chooses a good as a store of value, she is effectively increasing the demand for it beyond the regular market demand, which will cause its price to rise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1358">For example, market demand for copper in its various industrial uses is around 20 million tons per year, at a price of around $5,000 per ton, and a total market valued around $100 billion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1359">Imagine a billionaire deciding he would like to store $10 billion of his wealth in copper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1360">As his bankers run around trying to buy 10% of annual global copper production, they would inevitably cause the price of copper to increase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1361">Initially, this sounds like a vindication of the billionaire's monetary strategy: the asset he decided to buy has already appreciated before he has even completed his purchase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1362">Surely, he reasons, this appreciation will cause more people to buy more copper as a store of value, bringing the price up even more.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1363" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1364">But even if more people join him in</span><span type="pagebreak" title="20" id="calibre_link-584" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1365"> monetizing copper, our hypothetical copper‐obsessed billionaire is in trouble. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1366">The rising price makes copper a lucrative business for workers and capital across the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1367">The quantity of copper under the earth is beyond our ability to even measure, let alone extract through mining, so practically speaking, the only binding restraint on how much copper can be produced is how much labor and capital is dedicated to the job. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1368">More copper can always be made with a higher price, and the price and quantity will continue to rise until they satisfy the monetary investors' demand; let's assume that happens at 10 million extra tons and $10,000 per ton. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1369">At some point, monetary demand must subside, and some holders of copper will want to offload some of their stockpiles to purchase other goods, because, after all, that was the point of buying copper.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1370" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1371">After the monetary demand subsides, all else being equal, the copper market would go back to its original supply‐and‐demand conditions, with 20 million annual tons selling for $5,000 each. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1372">But as the holders begin to sell their accumulated stocks of copper, the price will drop significantly below that. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1373">The billionaire will have lost money in this process; as he was driving the price up, he bought most of his stock for more than $5,000 a ton, but now his entire stock is valued below $5,000 a ton. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1374">The others who joined him later bought at even higher prices and will have lost even more money than the billionaire himself.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1375" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1376">This model is applicable for all consumable commodities such as copper, zinc, nickel, brass, or oil, which are primarily consumed and destroyed, not stockpiled. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1377">Global stockpiles of these commodities at any moment in time are around the same order of magnitude as new annual production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1378">New supply is constantly being generated to be consumed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1379">Should savers decide to store their wealth in one of these commodities, their wealth will only buy a fraction of global supply before bidding the price up enough to absorb all their investment, because they are competing with the consumers of this commodity who use it productively in industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1380">As the revenue to the producers of the good increases, they can then invest in increasing their production, bringing the price crashing down again, robbing the savers of their wealth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1381">The net effect of this entire episode is the transfer of the wealth of the misguided savers to the producers of the commodity they purchased.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1382" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1383">This is the anatomy of a market</span><span type="pagebreak" title="21" id="calibre_link-585" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1384"> bubble: increased demand causes a sharp rise in prices, which drives further demand, raising prices further, incentivizing increased production and increased supply, which inevitably brings prices down, punishing everyone who bought at a price higher than the usual market price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1385">Investors in the bubble are fleeced while producers of the asset benefit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1386">For copper and almost every other commodity in the world, this dynamic has held true for most of recorded history, consistently punishing those who choose these commodities as money by devaluing their wealth and impoverishing them in the long run, and returning the commodity to its natural role as a market good, and not a medium of exchange.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1387" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1388">For anything to function as a good store of value, it has to beat this trap: it has to appreciate when people demand it as a store of value, but its producers have to be constrained from inflating the supply significantly enough to bring the price down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1389">Such an asset will reward those who choose it as their store of value, increasing their wealth in the long run as it becomes the prime store of value, because those who chose other commodities will either reverse course by copying the choice of their more successful peers, or will simply lose their wealth.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1390" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1391">The clear winner in this race throughout human history has been gold, which maintains its monetary role due to two unique physical characteristics that differentiate it from other commodities: first, gold is so chemically stable that it is virtually impossible to destroy, and second, gold is impossible to synthesize from other materials (alchemists' claims notwithstanding) and can only be extracted from its unrefined ore, which is extremely rare in our planet.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1392" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1393">The chemical stability of gold implies that virtually all of the gold ever mined by humans is still more or less owned by people around the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1394">Humanity has been accumulating an ever‐growing hoard of gold in jewelry, coins, and bars, which is never consumed and never rusts or disintegrates. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1395">The impossibility of synthesizing gold from other chemicals means that the only way to increase the supply of gold is by mining gold from the earth, an expensive, toxic, and uncertain process in which humans have been engaged for thousands of years with ever‐diminishing returns. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1396">This all means that the existing stockpile of gold held by people around the world is the product of thousands of years of gold production, and is orders of magnitude larger than new annual production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1397">Over the past seven decades with relatively</span><span type="pagebreak" title="22" id="calibre_link-263" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1398"> reliable statistics, this growth rate has always been around 1.5%, never exceeding 2%. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1399">(See </span><a id="calibre_link-690" href="#calibre_link-449" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1400">Figure 1</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1401">.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-710" href="#calibre_link-689" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1402">2</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1403">)</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-1413" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1414">Only silver comes close to gold in this regard, with an annual supply growth rate historically around 5&ndash;10%, rising to around 20% in the modern day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1415">This is higher than that of gold for two reasons: First, silver does corrode and can be consumed in industrial processes, which means the existing stockpiles are not as large relative to annual production as gold's stockpiles are relative to its annual production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1416">Second, silver is less rare than gold in the crust of the earth and easier to refine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1417">Because of having the second highest stock‐to‐flow ratio, and its lower value per unit of weight than gold, silver served for millennia as the main money used for smaller transactions, complementing gold, whose high value meant dividing it into smaller units, which was not very practical. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1418">The adoption of the international gold standard allowed for payments in paper backed by gold at any scale, as will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, which obviated silver's monetary role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1419">With silver no longer required for smaller transactions, it soon lost its monetary role and became an industrial metal, losing value compared to gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1420">Silver may maintain its sporting connotation for second place, but as nineteenth‐century technology made payments possible without having to move the monetary unit itself, second place in monetary competition was equivalent to losing out.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1421" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1422">This explains why the silver bubble has popped before and will pop again if it ever inflates: as soon as significant monetary investment flows into silver, it is not as difficult for producers to increase the supply significantly and bring the price crashing down, taking the savers' wealth in the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1423">The best‐known example of the easy‐money trap comes from silver itself, of all commodities. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1424">Back in the late 1970s, the very affluent Hunt brothers decided to bring about the remonetization of silver and started buying enormous quantities of silver, driving the price up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1425">Their rationale was that as the price rose, more people would want to buy, which would keep the price rising, which in turn would lead to people wanting to be paid in silver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1426">Yet, no matter how much the Hunt brothers bought, their wealth was no match for the ability of miners and holders of silver to keep selling silver onto the market. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1427">The price of silver eventually crashed and the Hunt brothers lost over $1bn, probably the highest price ever paid for learning the importance of the stock‐to‐flow ratio, and why not all that glitters is gold.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-711" href="#calibre_link-691" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1428">3</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1429"> (See </span><a id="calibre_link-693" href="#calibre_link-450" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1430">Figure 2</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1431">.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-712" href="#calibre_link-692" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1432">4</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1433">)</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-1467" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1468">The denarius was the silver coin that traded at the time of the Roman Republic, containing 3.9 grams of silver, while gold became the most valuable money in the civilized areas of the world at the time and gold coins were becoming more widespread. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1469">Julius Caesar, the last dictator of the Roman Republic, created the aureus coin, which contained around 8 grams of gold and was widely accepted across Europe and the Mediterranean, increasing the scope of trade and specialization in the Old World. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1470">Economic stability reigned for 75 years, even through the political upheaval of his assassination, which saw the Republic transformed into an Empire under his chosen successor, Augustus. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1471">This continued until the reign of the infamous emperor Nero, who was the first to engage in the Roman habit of “coin clipping,” wherein the Emperor would collect the coins of the population and mint them into newer coins with less gold or silver content.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1472" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1473">For as long as Rome could conquer new lands with significant wealth, its soldiers and emperors could enjoy spending their loot, and emperors even decided to buy themselves popularity by mandating artificially low prices of grains and other staples, sometimes even granting them for free. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1474">Instead of working for a living in the countryside, many peasants would leave their farms to move to Rome, where they could live better lives</span><span type="pagebreak" title="26" id="calibre_link-244" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1475"> for free. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1476">With time, the Old World no longer had prosperous lands to be conquered, the ever‐increasing lavish lifestyle and growing military required some new source of financing, and the number of unproductive citizens living off the emperor's largesse and price controls increased. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1477">Nero, who ruled from 54&ndash;68 AD, had found the formula to solve this, which was highly similar to Keynes's solution to Britain's and the U.S.'s problems after World War I: devaluing the currency would at once reduce the real wages of workers, reduce the burden of the government in subsidizing staples, and provide increased money for financing other government expenditure.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1478" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1479">The aureus coin was reduced from 8 to 7.2 grams, while the denarius's silver content was reduced from 3.9 to 3.41g. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1480">This provided some temporary relief, but had set in motion the highly destructive self‐reinforcing cycle of popular anger, price controls, coin debasement, and price rises, following one another with the predictable regularity of the four seasons.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-713" href="#calibre_link-694" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1481">5</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1482" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1483">Under the reign of Caracalla (AD 211&ndash;217), the gold content was further reduced to 6.5 grams, and under Diocletian (AD 284&ndash;305) it was further reduced to 5.5g, before he introduced a replacement coin called the solidus, with only 4.5 grams of gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1484">On Diocletian's watch, the denarius only had traces of silver to cover its bronze core, and the silver would disappear quite quickly with wear and tear, ending the denarius as a silver coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1485">As inflationism intensified in the third and fourth centuries, with it came the misguided attempts of the emperors to hide their inflation by placing price controls on basic goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1486">As market forces sought to adjust prices upward in response to the debasement of the currency, price ceilings prevented these price adjustments, making it unprofitable for producers to engage in production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1487">Economic production would come to a standstill until a new edict allowed for the liberalization of prices upward.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1488" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1489">With this fall in the value of its money, the long process of terminal decline of the empire resulted in a cycle that might appear familiar to modern readers: coin clipping reduced the aureus's real value, increasing the money supply, allowing the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="27" id="calibre_link-291" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1490"> emperor to continue imprudent overspending, but eventually resulting in inflation and economic crises, which the misguided emperors would attempt to ameliorate via further coin clipping. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1491">Ferdinand Lips summarizes this process with a lesson to modern readers:

<p id="calibre_link-1536" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1537">After the economic and military collapse of the Roman Empire, feudalism emerged as the prime mode of organizing society. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1538">The destruction of sound money was pivotal in turning the former citizens of the Roman Empire into serfs under the mercy of their local feudal lords. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1539">Gold was concentrated in the hands of the feudal lords, and the main forms of money available for the peasantry of Europe at the time were copper and bronze coins, whose supply was easy to inflate as industrial production of these metals continued to become easier with the advance of metallurgy, making them terrible stores of value, as well as silver coins that were usually debased, cheated, and nonstandardized across the continent, giving them poor salability across space and limiting the scope of trade across the continent.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-1554" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1555">Although the period following the introduction of the florin witnessed an improvement in the soundness of money, with more and more Europeans able to adopt gold and silver for saving and trade, and the extent of markets expanding across Europe and the world, the situation was far from perfect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1556">There were still many periods during which various sovereigns would debase their people's currency to finance war or lavish expenditure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1557">Given that they were used physically, silver and gold complemented each other: gold's high stock‐to‐flow ratio meant it was ideal as a long‐term store of value and a means of large payments, but silver's lower value per unit of weight made it easily divisible into quantities suitable for smaller transactions and for being held for shorter durations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1558">While this arrangement had benefits, it had one major drawback: the fluctuating rate of exchange between gold and silver created trade and calculation problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1559">Attempts to fix the price of the two currencies relative to one another were</span><span type="pagebreak" title="31" id="calibre_link-269" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1560"> continuously self‐defeating, but gold's monetary edge was to win out.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1561" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1562">As sovereigns set an exchange rate between the two commodities, they would change holders' incentives to hold or spend them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1563">This inconvenient bimetallism continued for centuries across Europe and the world, but as with the move from salt, cattle, and seashells to metals, the inexorable advance of technology was to provide a solution to it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1564" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1565">Two particular technological advancements would move Europe and the world away from physical coins and in turn help bring about the demise of silver's monetary role: the telegraph, first deployed commercially in 1837, and the growing network of trains, allowing transportation across Europe. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1566">With these two innovations, it became increasingly feasible for banks to communicate with each other, sending payments efficiently across space when needed and debiting accounts instead of having to send physical payments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1567">This led to the increased use of bills, checks, and paper receipts as monetary media instead of physical gold and silver coins.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1568" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1569">More nations began to switch to a monetary standard of paper fully backed by, and instantly redeemable into, precious metals held in vaults. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1570">Some nations would choose gold, and others would choose silver, in a fateful decision that was to have enormous consequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1571">Britain was the first to adopt a modern gold standard in 1717, under the direction of physicist Isaac Newton, who was the warden of the Royal Mint, and the gold standard would play a great role in it advancing its trade across its empire worldwide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1572">Britain would remain under a gold standard until 1914, although it would suspend it during the Napoleonic wars from 1797 to 1821. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1573">The economic supremacy of Britain was intricately linked to its being on a superior monetary standard, and other European countries began to follow it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1574">The end of the Napoleonic wars heralded the beginning of the golden age of Europe, as, one by one, the major European nations began adopting the gold standard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1575">The more nations officially adopted the gold standard, the more marketable gold became and the larger the incentive became for other nations to join.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1576" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1577">Further, instead of individuals having to carry gold and silver coins for large and small transactions, respectively, they could now store their wealth in gold in banks while using paper receipts, bills, and checks to make payments of any size. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1578">The holders of paper receipts could just use them to make payment themselves; bills</span><span type="pagebreak" title="32" id="calibre_link-270" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1579"> were discounted by banks and used for clearance and checks could be cashed from the banks that issued them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1580">This solved the problem of gold's salability across scales, making gold the best monetary medium&mdash;for as long as the banks hoarding people's gold would not increase the supply of papers they issued as receipts.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1581" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1582">With these media being backed by physical gold in the vaults and allowing payment in whichever quantity or size, there was no longer a real need for silver's role in small payments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1583">The death knell for silver's monetary role was the end of the Franco‐Prussian war, when Germany extracted an indemnity of £200 million in gold from France and used it to switch to a gold standard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1584">With Germany now joining Britain, France, Holland, Switzerland, Belgium, and others on a gold standard, the monetary pendulum had swung decisively in favor of gold, leading to individuals and nations worldwide who used silver to witness a progressive loss of their purchasing power and a stronger incentive to shift to gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1585">India finally switched from silver to gold in 1898, while China and Hong Kong were the last economies in the world to abandon the silver standard in 1935.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1586" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1587">For as long as gold and silver were used for payment directly, they both had a monetary role to play and their price relative to one another remained largely constant across time, at a ratio between 12 and 15 ounces of silver per ounce of gold, in the same range as their relative scarcity in the crust of the earth and the relative difficulty and cost of extracting them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1588">But as paper and financial instruments backed by these metals became more and more popular, there was no more justification for silver's monetary role, and individuals and nations shifted to holding gold, leading to a significant collapse in the price of silver, from which it would not recover. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1589">The average ratio between the two over the twentieth century was 47:1, and in 2017, it stood at 75:1. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1590">While gold still has a monetary role to play, as evidenced by central banks' hoarding of it, silver has arguably lost its monetary role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1591">(See </span><a id="calibre_link-699" href="#calibre_link-451" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1592">Figure 3</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1593">.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-717" href="#calibre_link-698" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1594">9</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1595">)</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-1610" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1611">With gold in the hands of increasingly centralized banks, it gained salability across time, scales, and location, but lost its property as cash money, making payments in it subject to the agreement of the financial and political authorities issuing receipts, clearing checks, and hoarding the gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1612">Tragically, the only way gold was able to solve the problems of salability across scales, space, and time was by being centralized and thus falling prey to the major problem of sound money emphasized by the economists of the twentieth century: individual sovereignty over money and its resistance to government centralized control. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1613">We can thus understand why nineteenth‐century sound money economists like Menger focused their understanding of money's soundness on its salability as a market good, whereas twentieth‐century sound money economists, like Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, and Salerno, focused their analysis of money's soundness on its resistance to control by a sovereign. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1614">Because the Achilles heel of 20th century money was its centralization in the hands of the government, we will see later how the money invented in the twenty‐first century, Bitcoin, was designed primarily to avoid centralized control.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-1698" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1699">This world came crashing down in the catastrophic year 1914, which was not only the year of the outbreak of World War I, but the year that the world's major economies went off of the gold standard and replaced it with unsound government money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1700">Only Switzerland and Sweden, who remained neutral during World War I, were to remain on a gold standard into the 1930s. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1701">The era of government‐controlled money was to commence globally after that, with unmitigated disastrous consequences.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1702" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1703">While the gold standard of the nineteenth century was arguably the closest thing that the world had ever seen to an ideal sound money, it nonetheless had its flaws. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1704">First, governments and banks were always creating media of exchange beyond the quantity of gold in their reserves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1705">Second, many countries used not just gold in their reserves, but also currencies of other countries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1706">Britain, as the global superpower at that time, had benefited from having its money used as a reserve currency all around the world, resulting in its reserves of gold being a tiny fraction of its outstanding money supply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1707">With growing international trade relying on settlement of large quantities of money across the world, the Bank of England's banknotes became, in the minds of many at the time, “as good as gold.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1708">While gold was very hard money, the instruments used for settlements of payments between central banks, although nominally redeemable in gold, ended up in practice being easier to produce than gold.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1709" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1710">These two flaws meant that the gold standard was always vulnerable to a run on gold in any country where circumstances might lead a large enough percentage of the population to demand redemption of their paper money in gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1711">The fatal flaw of the gold standard at the heart of these two problems was that settlement in physical gold is cumbersome, expensive, and insecure,</span><span type="pagebreak" title="38" id="calibre_link-317" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1712"> which meant it had to rely on centralizing physical gold reserves in a few locations&mdash;banks and central banks&mdash;leaving them vulnerable to being taken over by governments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1713">As the number of payments and settlements conducted in physical gold became an infinitely smaller fraction of all payments, the banks and central banks holding the gold could create money unbacked by physical gold and use it for settlement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1714">The network of settlement became valuable enough that its owners' credit was effectively monetized. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1715">As the ability to run a bank started to imply money creation, governments naturally gravitated to taking over the banking sector through central banking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1716">The temptation was always too strong, and the virtually infinite financial wealth this secured could not only silence dissent, but also finance propagandists to promote such ideas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1717">Gold offered no mechanism for restraining the sovereigns, and had to rely on trust in them not abusing the gold standard and the population remaining eternally vigilant against them doing so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1718">This might have been feasible when the population was highly educated and knowledgeable about the dangers of unsound money, but with every passing generation displaying the intellectual complacence that tends to accompany wealth,</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-721" href="#calibre_link-704" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1719">13</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1720"> the siren song of con artists and court‐jester economists would prove increasingly irresistible for more of the population, leaving only a minority of knowledgeable economists and historians fighting an uphill battle to convince people that wealth can't be generated by tampering with the money supply, that allowing a sovereign the control of the money can only lead to them increasing their control of everyone's life, and that civilized human living itself rests on the integrity of money providing a solid foundation for trade and capital accumulation.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-1840" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1841">World War I saw the end of the era of monetary media being the choice decided by the free market, and the beginning of the era of government money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1842">While gold continues to underpin the global monetary system to this day, government edicts, decisions, and monetary policy shape the monetary reality of the world more than any aspect of individual choice.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1843" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1844">The common name for government money is </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1845">fiat money</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1846">, from the Latin word for decree, order, or authorization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1847">Two important facts must be understood about government money from the outset. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1848">First, there is a very large difference between government money redeemable in gold, and irredeemable government money, even if both are run by the government. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1849">Under a gold standard, money is gold, and government just assumes a responsibility of minting standard units of the metal or printing paper backed by the gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1850">The government has no control over the supply of gold in the economy, and people are able to redeem their paper in physical gold at any time, and use other shapes and forms of gold, such as bullion bars and foreign coins, in their dealings with one another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1851">With irredeemable government</span><span type="pagebreak" title="42" id="calibre_link-586" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1852"> money, on the other hand, the government's debt and/or paper is used as money, and the government is able to increase its supply as it sees fit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1853">Should anybody use other forms of money for exchange, or should they attempt to create more of the government's money, they run the risk of punishment.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1854" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1855">The second and often overlooked fact, is that, contrary to what the name might imply, no fiat money has come into circulation solely through government fiat; they were all originally redeemable in gold or silver, or currencies that were redeemable in gold or silver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1856">Only through redeemability into salable forms of money did government paper money gain its salability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1857">Government may issue decrees mandating people use their paper for payments, but no government has imposed this salability on papers without these papers having first been redeemable in gold and silver. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1858">Until this day, all government central banks maintain reserves to back up the value of their national currency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1859">The majority of countries maintain some gold in their reserves, and those countries which do not have gold reserves maintain reserves in the form of other countries' fiat currencies, which are in turn backed by gold reserves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1860">No pure fiat currency exists in circulation without any form of backing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1861">Contrary to the most egregiously erroneous and central tenet of the state theory of money, it was not government that decreed gold as money; rather, it is only by holding gold that governments could get their money to be accepted at all.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1862" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1863">The oldest recorded example of fiat money was </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1864">jiaozi</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1865">, a paper currency issued by the Song dynasty in China in the tenth century. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1866">Initially, </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1867">jiaozi</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1868"> was a receipt for gold or silver, but then government controlled its issuance and suspended redeemability, increasing the amount of currency printed until it collapsed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1869">The Yuan dynasty also issued fiat currency in 1260, named </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1870">chao</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1871">, and exceeded the supply far beyond the metal backing, with predictably disastrous consequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1872">As the value of the money collapsed, the people fell into abject poverty, with many peasants resorting to selling their children into debt slavery.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1873" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1874">Government money, then, is similar to primitive forms of money discussed in </span><a href="#calibre_link-38" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1875">Chapter 2</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1876">, and commodities other than gold, in that it is liable to having its supply increased quickly compared to its stock, leading to a quick loss of salability, destruction of purchasing power, and impoverishment of its holders. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1877">In this respect it differs from gold, whose supply cannot be increased due to the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="43" id="calibre_link-275" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1878"> fundamental chemical properties of the metal discussed above. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1879">That the government demands payment in its money for its taxes may guarantee a longer life for that money, but only if the government is able to prevent the quick expansion of the supply can it protect its value from depreciating quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1880">When comparing different national currencies, we find that the major and most widely used national currencies have a lower annual increase in their supply than the less salable minor currencies.</span></p></section>

<h2 id="calibre_link-529" class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1882">Monetary Nationalism and the End of the Free World</span></h2>
<p id="calibre_link-1883" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1884">The many enemies of sound money whom Mises named in the quote referenced at the end of the last chapter were to have their victory over the gold standard with the beginning of a small war in Central Europe in 1914, which snowballed into the first global war in human history. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1885">Certainly, when the war started nobody had envisioned it lasting as long, and producing as many casualties, as it did. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1886">British newspapers, for example, heralded it as the August Bank Holiday War, expecting it to be a simple triumphant summer excursion for their troops. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1887">There was a sense that this would be a limited conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1888">And, after decades of relative peace across Europe, a new generation of Europeans had not grown to appreciate the likely consequences of launching war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1889">Today, historians still fail to offer a convincing strategic or geopolitical explanation for why a conflict between the Austro‐Hungarian Empire and Serbian separatists was to trigger a global war that claimed the lives of millions and drastically reshaped most of the world's borders.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1890" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1891">In retrospect, the major difference between World War I and the previous limited wars was neither geopolitical nor strategic, but rather, it was monetary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1892">When governments were on a gold standard, they had direct control of large vaults of gold while their people were dealing with paper receipts of this gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1893">The ease with which a government could issue more paper currency was too tempting in the heat of the conflict, and far easier than demanding taxation from the citizens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1894">Within a few weeks of the war starting, all major belligerents had suspended gold convertibility, effectively going off the gold standard and putting their population on a fiat standard, wherein</span><span type="pagebreak" title="44" id="calibre_link-292" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1895"> the money they used was government‐issued paper that was not redeemable for gold.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1896" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1897">With the simple suspension of gold redeemability, governments' war efforts were no longer limited to the money that they had in their own treasuries, but extended virtually to the entire wealth of the population. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1898">For as long as the government could print more money and have that money accepted by its citizens and foreigners, it could keep financing the war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1899">Previously, under a monetary system where gold as money was in the hands of the people, government only had its own treasuries to sustain its war effort, along with any taxation or bond issues to finance the war. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1900">This made conflict limited, and lay at the heart of the relatively long periods of peace experienced around the world before the twentieth century.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1901" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1902">Had European nations remained on the gold standard, or had the people of Europe held their own gold in their own hands, forcing government to resort to taxation instead of inflation, history might have been different. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1903">It is likely that World War I would have been settled militarily within a few months of conflict, as one of the allied factions started running out of financing and faced difficulties in extracting wealth from a population that was not willing to part with its wealth to defend their regime's survival. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1904">But with the suspension of the gold standard, running out of financing was not enough to end the war; a sovereign had to run out of its people's accumulated wealth expropriated through inflation.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1905" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1906">European countries devaluing their currency allowed the bloody stalemate to continue for four years, with no resolution or advancement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1907">The senselessness of it all was not lost on the populations of these countries, and the soldiers on the front line risking their lives for no apparent reason but the unbounded vanity and ambition of monarchs who were usually related and intermarried. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1908">In the most vivid personification of the absolute senselessness of this war, on Christmas Eve 1914, French, English, and German soldiers stopped following orders to fight, laid down their arms, and crossed the battle lines to mingle and socialize with one another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1909">Many of the German soldiers had worked in England and could speak English, and most soldiers had a fondness for football, and so many impromptu games were organized between the teams.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-77" href="#calibre_link-39" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1910">1</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1911"> The astounding fact exposed by this truce</span><span type="pagebreak" title="45" id="calibre_link-293" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1912"> is that these soldiers had nothing against each other, had nothing to gain from fighting this war, and could see no reason to continue it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1913">A far better outlet for their nations' rivalry would be in football, a universally popular game where tribal and national affiliations can be played out peacefully.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-1914" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1915">The war was to continue for four more years with barely any progress, until the United States was to intervene in 1917 and swing the war in favor of one party at the expense of the other by bringing in a large amount of resources with which their enemies could no longer keep up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1916">While all governments were funding their war machines with inflation, Germany and the Austro‐Hungarian Empire began to witness serious decline in the value of their currency in 1918, making their defeat inevitable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1917">Comparing the belligerents' currencies' exchange rates to the Swiss Franc, which was still on the gold standard at the time, provides a useful measure of the devaluation each currency experienced, as is shown in </span><a id="calibre_link-42" href="#calibre_link-40" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1918">Figure 5</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1919">.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-78" href="#calibre_link-41" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-1920">2</span></a></sup></p>

<p id="calibre_link-2140" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2141">In the Bretton Woods system, however, governments were dominated by Keynesian economists who viewed activist fiscal and monetary policy as a natural and important part of government policy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2142">The constant monetary and fiscal management would naturally lead to the fluctuation of the value of national currencies, resulting in imbalances in trade and capital flows. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2143">When a country's currency is devalued, its products become cheaper to foreigners, leading to more goods leaving the country, while holders of the currency seek to purchase foreign currencies to protect themselves from devaluation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2144">As</span><span type="pagebreak" title="57" id="calibre_link-195" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2145"> devaluation is usually accompanied by artificially low interest rates, capital seeks exit from the country to go where it can be better rewarded, exacerbating the devaluation of the currency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2146">On the other hand, countries which maintained their currency better than others would thus witness an influx of capital whenever their neighbors devalued, leading to their currency appreciating further. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2147">Devaluation would sow the seeds of more devaluation, whereas currency appreciation would lead to more appreciation, creating a problematic dynamic for the two governments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2148">No such problems could exist with the gold standard, where the value of the currency in both countries was constant, because it was gold, and movements of goods and capital would not affect the value of the currency.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2149" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2150">The automatic adjustment mechanisms of the gold standard had always provided a constant measuring rod against which all economic activity was measured, but the floating currencies gave the world economy imbalances. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2151">The International Monetary Fund's role was to perform an impossible balancing act between all the world's governments to attempt to find some form of stability or “equilibrium” in this mess, keeping exchange rates within some arbitrary range of predetermined values while trade and capital flows were moving and altering them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2152">But without a stable unit of account for the global economy, this was a task as hopeless as attempting to build a house with an elastic measuring tape whose own length varied every time it was used.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2153" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2154">Along with the establishment of the World Bank and IMF in Bretton Woods, the United States and its allies wanted to establish another international financial institution to specialize in arranging trade policy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2155">The initial attempt to establish an International Trade Organization failed after the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2156">Congress refused to ratify the treaty, but a replacement was sought in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, commencing in 1948. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2157">GATT was meant to help the IMF in the impossible task of balancing budgets and trade to ensure financial stability&mdash;in other words, centrally planning global trade and fiscal and monetary policy to remain in balance, as if such a thing were possible.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2158" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2159">An important, but often overlooked, aspect of the Bretton Woods system was that most of the member countries had moved large amounts of their gold reserves to the United States and received dollars in exchange, at a rate of $35 per ounce. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2160">The rationale was that the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2161">dollar would be the global currency for</span><span type="pagebreak" title="58" id="calibre_link-260" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2162"> trade and central banks would trade through it and settle their accounts in it, obviating the need for the physical movement of gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2163">In essence, this system was akin to the entire world economy being run as one country on a gold standard, with the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2164">Federal Reserve acting as the world's central bank and all the world's central banks as regional banks, the main difference being that the monetary discipline of the gold standard was almost entirely lost in this world where there were no effective controls on all central banks in expanding the money supply, because no citizens could redeem their government money for gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2165">Only governments could redeem their dollars in gold from the United States, but that was to prove far more complicated than expected. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2166">Today, each ounce of gold for which foreign central banks received $35 is worth in excess of $1,200.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2167" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2168">Monetary expansionism became the new global norm, and the tenuous link that the system had to gold proved powerless to stop the debauching of global currencies and the constant balance of payment crises affecting most countries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2169">The United States, however, was put in a remarkable position, similar to, though massively exceeding in scope, the Roman Empire's pillaging and inflating the money supply used by most of the Old World. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2170">With its currency distributed all over the world, and central banks having to hold it as a reserve to trade with one another, the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2171">government could accrue significant seniorage from expanding the supply of dollars, and also had no reason to worry about running a balance of payment deficit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2172">French economist Jacques Reuff coined the phrase “deficit without tears” to describe the new economic reality that the United States inhabited, where it could purchase whatever it wanted from the world and finance it through debt monetized by inflating the currency that the entire world used.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2173" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2174">The relative fiscal restraint of the first few years after World War II soon gave way to the politically irresistible temptation of buying free lunches through inflation, particularly to the warfare and welfare states. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2175">The military industry that prospered during World War II grew into what President Eisenhower called the Military&ndash;Industrial Complex&mdash;an enormous conglomerate of industries that was powerful enough to demand ever more funding from the government, and drive U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2176">foreign policy toward an endless series of expensive conflicts with no rational end goal or clear objective. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2177">The doctrine of violent militant Keynesianism claimed this spending would</span><span type="pagebreak" title="59" id="calibre_link-214" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2178"> be good for the economy, which made the millions of lives it destroyed easier to stomach for the American electorate.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2179" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2180">This war machine was also made more palatable for the American people because it came from the same politicians who intensified government welfare in various shapes and forms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2181">From The Great Society to affordable housing, education, and healthcare, fiat money allowed the American electorate to ignore the laws of economics and believe that a free lunch, or at least a perpetually discounted one, was somehow possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2182">In the absence of gold convertibility and with the ability to disperse the costs of inflation on the rest of the world, the only winning political formula consisted of increasing government spending financed by inflation, and every single presidential term in the postwar era witnessed a growth in government expenditure and the national debt and a loss of the purchasing power of the dollar. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2183">In the presence of fiat money to finance government, political differences between parties disappear as politics no longer contains trade‐offs and every candidate can champion every cause.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-2186" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2187">The tenuous link of gold exchangeability was an annoying detail for the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2188">government's inflationism, and it manifested in two symptoms: first, the global gold market was always seeking to reflect the reality of inflationism through a higher gold price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2189">This was addressed through the establishment of the London Gold Pool, which sought to drop the price of gold by offloading some of the gold reserves that governments held onto the market. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2190">This worked only temporarily, but in 1968, the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2191">dollar had to start getting revalued compared to gold to acknowledge the years of inflation it had suffered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2192">The second problem was that some countries started trying to repatriate their gold reserves from the United States as they started to recognize the diminishing purchasing power of their paper money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2193">French president Charles de Gaulle even sent a French military carrier to New York to get his nation's gold back, but when the Germans attempted to repatriate their gold, the United States had decided it had had enough. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2194">Gold reserves were running low, and on August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon announced the end of dollar convertibility to gold, thus letting</span><span type="pagebreak" title="60" id="calibre_link-294" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2195"> the gold price float in the market freely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2196">In effect, the United States had defaulted on its commitment to redeem its dollars in gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2197">The fixed exchange rates between the world's currencies, which the IMF was tasked with maintaining, had now been let loose to be determined by the movement of goods and capital across borders and in ever‐more‐sophisticated foreign exchange markets.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2198" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2199">Freed from the final constraints of the pretense of gold redemption, the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2200">government expanded its monetary policy in unprecedented scale, causing a large drop in the purchasing power of the dollar, and a rise in prices across the board. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2201">Everyone and everything was blamed for the rise in prices by the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2202">government and its economists, except for the one actual source of the price rises, the increase in the supply of the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2203">dollar. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2204">Most other currencies fared even worse, as they were the victim of inflation of the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2205">dollars backing them, as well as the inflation by the central banks issuing them.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2206" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2207">This move by President Nixon completed the process begun with World War I, transforming the world economy from a global gold standard to a standard based on several government‐issued currencies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2208">For a world that was growing increasingly globalized along with advancements in transportation and telecommunications, freely fluctuating exchange rates constituted what Hoppe termed “a system of partial barter.”</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-89" href="#calibre_link-55" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2209">13</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2210"> Buying things from people who lived on the other side of imaginary lines in the sand now required utilizing more than one medium of exchange and reignited the age‐old problem of lack of coincidence of wants. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2211">The seller does not want the currency held by the buyer, and so the buyer must purchase another currency first, and incur conversion costs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2212">As advances in transportation and telecommunications continue to increase global economic integration, the cost of these inefficiencies just keeps getting bigger. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2213">The market for foreign exchange, at $5 trillion of daily volume, exists purely as a result of this inefficiency of the absence of a single global homogeneous international currency.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2214" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2215">While most governments produce their own currencies, the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2216">government was the one that produced the prime reserve currency with which other governments backed theirs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2217">This</span><span type="pagebreak" title="61" id="calibre_link-295" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2218"> was the first time in human history that the entire planet had run on government money, and while such an idea is considered normal and unquestionable in most academic circles, it is well worth examining the soundness of this predominant form of money.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2219" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2220">It is theoretically possible to create an artificially scarce asset to endow it with a monetary role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2221">Governments around the world did this after abandoning the gold standard, as did Bitcoin's creator, with contrasting results. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2222">After the link between fiat money and gold was severed, paper monies have had a higher growth in their supply rate than gold, and as a result have seen a collapse in their value compared to gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2223">The total U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2224">M2 measure of the money supply in 1971 was around $600 billion, while today it is in excess of $12 trillion, growing at an average annual rate of 6.7%. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2225">Correspondingly, in 1971, 1 ounce of gold was worth $35, and today it is worth more than $1,200.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2226" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2227">Looking at the track record of government money paints a mixed picture about the stock‐to‐flow ratio of different currencies across time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2228">The relatively stable and strong currencies of the developed countries have usually had growth rates in the single digits, but with a much higher variance, including contractions of the supply during deflationary recessions.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-90" href="#calibre_link-56" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2229">14</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2230"> Developing country currencies have at many times experienced supply growth rates closer to those of consumable commodities, leading to disastrous hyperinflation and the destruction of the wealth of holders. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2231">The World Bank provides data on broad money growth for 167 countries for the period between 1960 and 2015. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2232">The data for the annual average for all countries is plotted in </span><a id="calibre_link-58" href="#calibre_link-57" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2233">Figure 6</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2234">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2235">While the data is not complete for all countries and all years, the average growth of money supply is 32.16% per year per country.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-2346" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2347">Hyperinflation is a far more pernicious phenomenon than just the loss of a lot of economic value by a lot of people; it constitutes a complete breakdown of the structure of economic production of a society built up over centuries and millennia. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2348">With the collapse of money, it becomes impossible to trade, produce, or engage in anything other than scraping for the bare essentials of life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2349">As the structures of production and trade that societies have developed over centuries break down due to the inability of consumers, producers, and workers to pay one another, the goods which humans take for granted begin to disappear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2350">Capital is destroyed and sold off to finance consumption. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2351">First go the luxury goods, but soon follow the basic essentials of survival, until humans are brought back to a barbaric state wherein they need to fend for themselves and struggle to secure the most basic needs of survival. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2352">As the individual's quality of life degenerates markedly, despair begins to turn to anger, scapegoats are sought, and the most demagogic and opportunistic politicians take advantage of this situation, stoking people's anger to gain power. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2353">The most vivid example of this is inflation of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s, which not only led to the destruction and breakdown of one of the world's most advanced and prosperous economies, but also fueled the rise of Adolf Hitler to power.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-2381" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2382">A few reasons keep government money as the prime money of our time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2383">First, governments mandate that taxes are paid in government money, which means individuals are highly likely to accept it, giving it an edge in its salability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2384">Second, government control and regulation of the banking system means that banks can only open accounts and transact in government‐sanctioned money, thus giving government money a much higher degree of salability than any other potential competitor. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2385">Third, legal tender laws make it illegal in many countries to use other forms of money for payment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2386">Fourth, all government moneys are still backed by gold reserves, or backed by currencies backed by gold reserves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2387">According to data from the World Gold Council, central banks currently have around 33,000 tons of gold in their reserves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2388">Central bank gold reserves rose quickly in the early part of the twentieth century as many governments confiscated their people's and banks' gold and forced them to use their money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2389">In the late 1960s, with the Bretton Woods system straining under the pressure of increased money supply, governments began to offload some of their gold reserves. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2390">But in 2008 that trend reversed and central banks returned to buying gold and the global supply has increased. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2391">It is ironic, and very telling, that in the era of government money, governments themselves own far more gold in their official reserves than they did under the international gold standard of 1871&ndash;1914. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2392">Gold has clearly not lost its monetary role; it remains the only final extinguisher</span><span type="pagebreak" title="69" id="calibre_link-215" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2393"> of debt, the one money whose value is not a liability of anyone else, and the prime global asset which carries no counterparty risk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2394">Access to its monetary role, however, has been restricted to central banks, while individuals have been directed toward using government money.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2395" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2396">Central banks' large reserves of gold can be used as an emergency supply to sell or lease on the gold market to prevent the price of gold from rising during periods of increased demand, to protect the monopoly role of government money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2397">As Alan Greenspan once explained: “Central banks stand ready to lease gold in increasing quantities should the price rise.”</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-98" href="#calibre_link-72" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2398">22</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2399"> (See </span><a id="calibre_link-2400" href="#calibre_link-73" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2401">Figure 4</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2402">.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-99" href="#calibre_link-74" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2403">23</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2404">)</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-2413" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2414">Government control of money</span><span type="pagebreak" title="70" id="calibre_link-179" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2415"> has turned money from being the reward for producing value to the reward for obedience to government officials. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2416">It is impractical for anyone to develop wealth in government money without government acceptance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2417">Government can confiscate money from the banking monopolies it controls, inflate the currency to devalue holders' wealth and reward it to the most loyal of its subjects, impose draconian taxes and punish those who avoid them, and even confiscate bills.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2418" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2419">Whereas in Austrian economist Menger's time the criteria for determining what is the best money revolved around understanding salability and what the market would choose as money, in the twentieth century, government control of money has meant a new and very important criterion being added to salability, and that is the salability of money according to the will of its holder and not some other party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2420">Combining these criteria together formulates a complete understanding of the term </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2421">sound money</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2422"> as the money that is chosen by the market freely and the money completely under the control of the person who earned it legitimately on the free market and not any other third party.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2423" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2424">While a staunch defender of the role of gold as money during his time, Ludwig von Mises understood that this monetary role was not something inherent or intrinsic to gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2425">As one of the deans of the Austrian tradition in economics, Mises well understood that value does not exist outside of human consciousness, and that metals and substances had nothing inherent to them that could assign to them a monetary role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2426">For Mises, gold's monetary status was due to its fulfillment of the criteria for sound money as he understood them:

<p id="calibre_link-2588" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2589">Sound money is chosen freely on the market for its salability, because it holds its value across time, because it can transfer value effectively across space, and because it can be divided and grouped into small and large scales. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2590">It is money whose supply cannot be manipulated by a coercive authority that imposes its use on others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2591">From the preceding discussion, and from the understanding of monetary economics afforded to us by Austrian economics, the importance of sound money can be explained for three broad reasons: first, it protects value across time, which gives people a bigger incentive to think of their future, and lowers their time preference. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2592">The lowering of the time preference is what initiates the process of human civilization and allows for humans to cooperate, prosper, and live in peace. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2593">Second, sound money allows for trade to be based on a stable unit of measurement, facilitating ever‐larger markets, free from government control and coercion, and with free trade comes peace and prosperity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2594">Further, a unit of account is essential for all forms</span><span type="pagebreak" title="74" id="calibre_link-354" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2595"> of economic calculation and planning, and unsound money makes economic calculation unreliable and is the root cause of economic recessions and crises. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2596">Finally, sound money is an essential requirement for individual freedom from despotism and repression, as the ability of a coercive state to create money can give it undue power over its subjects, power which by its very nature will attract the least worthy, and most immoral, to take its reins.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2597" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2598">Sound money is a prime factor in determining individual </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2599">time preference</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2600">, an enormously important and widely neglected aspect of individual decision making. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2601">Time preference refers to the ratio at which individuals value the present compared to the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2602">Because humans do not live eternally, death could come to us at any point in time, making the future uncertain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2603">And because consumption is necessary for survival, people always value present consumption more than future consumption, as the lack of present consumption could make the future never arrive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2604">In other words, time preference is positive for all humans; there is always a discount on the future compared to the present.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-2698" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2699">There are many factors that come into play in determining the time preference of individuals.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-431" href="#calibre_link-402" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2700">3</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2701"> Security of people in their person and property is arguably one of the most important. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2702">Individuals who live in areas of conflict and crime will have a significant chance of losing their life and are thus likely to more highly discount the future, resulting in a higher time preference than those who live in peaceful societies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2703">Security of property is another major factor influencing individuals' time preference: societies where governments or thieves are likely to expropriate individuals' property capriciously would have higher time preference, as such actions would drive individuals to prioritize spending their resources on immediate gratification rather than investing them in property which could be appropriated at any time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2704">Tax rates will also adversely affect time preference: the higher the taxes, the less of their income that individuals are allowed to keep; this would lead to individuals working less at the margin and saving less for their future, because the burden of taxes is more likely to reduce savings than consumption, particularly for those with a low income, most of which is needed for basic survival.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2705" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2706">The factor affecting time preference that is most relevant to our discussion, however, is the expected future value of money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2707">In a free market where people are free to choose their</span><span type="pagebreak" title="80" id="calibre_link-299" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2708"> money, they will choose the form of money most likely to hold its value over time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2709">The better the money is at holding its value, the more it incentivizes people to delay consumption and instead dedicate resources for production in the future, leading to capital accumulation and improvement of living standards, while also engendering in people a low time preference in other, non‐economic aspects of their life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2710">When economic decision making is geared toward the future, it is natural that all manner of decisions are geared toward the future as well. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2711">People become more peaceful and cooperative, understanding that cooperation is a far more rewarding long‐term strategy than any short‐term gains from conflict. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2712">People develop a strong sense of morality, prioritizing the moral choices that will cause the best long‐term outcomes for them and their children. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2713">A person who thinks of the long run is less likely to cheat, lie, or steal, because the reward for such activities may be positive in the short run, but can be devastatingly negative in the long run.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2714" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2715">The reduction in the purchasing power of money is similar to a form of taxation or expropriation, reducing the real value of one's money even while the nominal value is constant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2716">In modern economies government‐issued money is inextricably linked to artificially lower interest rates, which is a desirable goal for modern economists because it promotes borrowing and investing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2717">But the effect of this manipulation of the price of capital is to artificially reduce the interest rate that accrues to savers and investors, as well as the one paid by borrowers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2718">The natural implication of this process is to reduce savings and increase borrowing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2719">At the margin, individuals will consume more of their income and borrow more against the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2720">This will not just have implications on their time preference in financial decisions; it will likely reflect on everything in their lives.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2721" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2722">The move from money that holds its value or appreciates to money that loses its value is very significant in the long run: society saves less, accumulates less capital, and possibly begins to consume its capital; worker productivity stays constant or declines, resulting in the stagnation of real wages, even if nominal wages can be made to increase through the magical power of printing ever more depreciating pieces of paper money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2723">As people start spending more and saving less, they become more present‐oriented in all their decision making, resulting in moral failings and a likelihood to</span><span type="pagebreak" title="81" id="calibre_link-296" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2724"> engage in conflict and destructive and self‐destructive behavior.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-2744" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2745">It had, however, proved impossible to come up with a form of money of which more cannot be created. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2746">Whatever gets chosen as a medium of exchange will appreciate in value and lead to more people trying to produce more of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2747">The best form of money in history was the one that would cause the new supply of money to be the least significant compared to the existing stockpiles, and thus make its creation not a good source of profit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2748">Seeing as gold is indestructible, it is the one metal whose stockpiles have only been growing since the first human mined it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2749">Seeing as this mining has been going on for thousands of years, and alchemy has yet to prove large‐scale commercial viability, new mining supply continues to be a reliably tiny fraction of existing stockpiles.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-2911" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2912">Only Switzerland, which remained on an official gold standard until 1934, and continued to back its currency with large reserves of gold until the early 1990s, has continued to have a high savings rate, standing as the last bastion of low‐time‐preference Western civilization with a savings rate in the double digits, as every other Western economy has plummeted into the single digits and even to negative saving rates in some cases. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2913">The average savings rate of the seven largest advanced economies</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-440" href="#calibre_link-421" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2914">12</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2915"> was 12.66% in 1970, but</span><span type="pagebreak" title="91" id="calibre_link-306" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2916"> has dropped to 3.39% in 2015, a fall of almost three‐quarters.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2917" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2918">While savings rates have plummeted across the western world, indebtedness continues to rise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2919">The average household in the West is indebted by more than 100% of its annual income, while the total debt burden of the various levels of government and households exceeds GDP by multiples, with significant consequences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2920">Such numbers have become normalized as Keynesian economists assure citizens that debt is good for growth and that saving would result in recessions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2921">One of the most mendacious fantasies that pervades Keynesian economic thought is the idea that the national debt “does not matter, since we owe it to ourselves.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2922">Only a high‐time‐preference disciple of Keynes could fail to understand that this “ourselves” is not one homogeneous blob but is differentiated into several generations&mdash;namely, the current ones which consume recklessly at the expense of future ones. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2923">To make matters worse, this phrase is usually followed by emotional blackmail along the lines of “we would be short‐changing ourselves if we didn't borrow to invest for our future.”</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2924" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2925">Many pretend this is a miraculous modern discovery from Keynes's brilliant insight that spending is all that matters, and that by ensuring spending remains high, debts can continue to grow indefinitely and savings can be eliminated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2926">In reality, there is nothing new in this policy, which was employed by the decadent emperors of Rome during its decline, except that it is being applied</span><span type="pagebreak" title="92" id="calibre_link-202" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2927"> with government‐issued paper money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2928">Indeed, paper money allows it to be managed a little more smoothly, and less obviously, than the metallic coins of old. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2929">But the results are the same.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2930" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2931">The twentieth century's binge on conspicuous consumption cannot be understood separately from the destruction of sound money and the outbreak of Keynesian high‐time‐preference thinking, in vilifying savings and deifying consumption as the key to economic prosperity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2932">The reduced incentive to save is mirrored with an increased incentive to spend, and with interest rates regularly manipulated downwards and banks able to issue more credit than ever, lending stopped being restricted to investment, but has moved on to consumption. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2933">Credit cards and consumer loans allow individuals to borrow for the sake of consumption without even the pretense of performing investment in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2934">It is an ironic sign of the depth of modern‐day economic ignorance fomented by Keynesian economics that capitalism&mdash;an economic system based on </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2935">capital accumulation</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2936"> from saving&mdash;is blamed for unleashing conspicuous consumption&mdash;the exact opposite of capital accumulation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2937">Capitalism is what happens when people drop their time preference, defer immediate gratification, and invest in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2938">Debt‐fueled mass consumption is as much a normal part of capitalism as asphyxiation is a normal part of respiration.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2939" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2940">This also helps explain one of the key Keynesian misunderstandings of economics, which considers that delaying current consumption by saving will put workers out of work and cause economic production to stall. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2941">Keynes viewed the level of spending at any point in time as being the most important determinant of the state of the economy because, having studied no economics, he had no understanding of capital theory and how employment does not only have to be in final goods, but can also be in the production of capital goods which will only produce final goods in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2942">And having lived off of his family's considerable fortune without having to work real jobs, Keynes had no appreciation of saving or capital accumulation and their essential role in economic growth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2943">Hence, Keynes would observe a recession concurrently with a fall in consumer spending and increase in saving, and assume the causality runs from increased savings to decreased consumption to recession. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2944">Had he had the temperament to study capital theory, he would have understood that the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="93" id="calibre_link-337" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2945"> decreased consumption was a natural reaction to the business cycle, which was in turn caused by the expansion of the money supply, as will be discussed in </span><a href="#calibre_link-24" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2946">Chapter 6</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2947">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2948">He would also have understood that the only cause of economic growth in the first place is delayed gratification, saving, and investment, which extend the length of the production cycle and increase the productivity of the methods of production, leading to better standards of living. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2949">He would have realized the only reason he was born into a rich family in a rich society was that his ancestors had spent centuries accumulating capital, deferring gratification and investing in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2950">But, like the Roman emperors during the decay of the empire, he could never understand the work and sacrifice needed to build his affluence and believed instead that high consumption is the cause of prosperity rather than its consequence.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2951" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2952">Debt is the opposite of saving. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2953">If saving creates the possibility of capital accumulation and civilizational advance, debt is what can reverse it, through the reduction in capital stocks across generations, reduced productivity, and a decline in living standards. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2954">Whether it is housing debt, Social Security obligations, or government debt that will require ever‐higher taxes and debt monetization to refinance, the current generations may be the first in the western world since the demise of the Roman Empire (or, at least, the Industrial Revolution) to come into the world with less capital than their parents. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2955">Rather than witness their savings accumulate and raise the capital stock, this generation has to work to pay off the growing interest on its debt, working harder to fund entitlement programs they will barely get to enjoy while paying higher taxes and barely being able to save for their old age.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2956" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2957">This move from sound money to depreciating money has led to several generations of accumulated wealth being squandered on conspicuous consumption within a generation or two, making indebtedness the new method for funding major expenses. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2958">Whereas 100 years ago most people would pay for their house, education, or marriage from their own labor or accumulated savings, such a notion seems ridiculous to people today. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2959">Even the wealthy will not live within their means and will instead use their wealth to allow them larger loans to finance large purchases. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2960">This sort of arrangement can last for a while, but its lasting cannot be mistaken for sustainability, as it is no more than the systematic consumption of the capital</span><span type="pagebreak" title="94" id="calibre_link-594" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2961"> stock of society&mdash;the eating of the seed crop.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2962" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2963">When money was nationalized, it was placed under the command of politicians who operate over short time‐horizons of a few years, trying their best to get reelected. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2964">It was only natural that such a process would lead to short‐term decision making where politicians abuse the currency to fund their reelection campaigns at the expense of future generations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2965">As H. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2966">L. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2967">Mencken put it: “Every election is an advanced auction on stolen goods.”</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-441" href="#calibre_link-422" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2968">13</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2969"> In a society where money is free and sound, individuals have to make decisions with their capital that affect their families in the long run. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2970">While it is likely that some would make irresponsible decisions that hurt their offspring, those who wanted to make responsible decisions had the choice to do so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2971">With nationalized money, that became an increasingly harder choice to make, as central governmental control of money supply inevitably destroys incentives to save while increasing the incentive to borrow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2972">No matter how prudent a person, his children will still witness their savings lose value and have to pay taxes to cover for the inflationary largesse of their government.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2973" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2974">As the reduction in intergenerational inheritance has reduced the strength of the family as a unit, government's unlimited checkbook has increased its ability to direct and shape the lives of people, allowing it an increasingly important role to play in more aspects of individuals' lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2975">The family's ability to finance the individual has been eclipsed by the state's largesse, resulting in a declining incentives for maintaining a family.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2976" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2977">In a traditional society, individuals are aware that they will need children to support them in the future, and so will spend their healthy young years starting a family and investing in giving their children the best life possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2978">But if long‐term investment in general is disincentivized, if saving is likely to be counterproductive as money depreciates, this investment becomes less profitable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2979">Further, as politicians sell people the lie that eternal welfare and retirement benefits are possible through the magic of the monetary printing press, the investment in a family becomes less and less valuable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2980">Over time, the incentive to start a family declines and more and more people</span><span type="pagebreak" title="95" id="calibre_link-193" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2981"> end up leading single lives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2982">More marriages are likely to break down as partners are less likely to put in the necessary emotional, moral, and financial investment to make them work, while marriages that do survive will likely produce fewer children. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2983">The well‐known phenomenon of the modern breakdown of the family cannot be understood without recognizing the role of unsound money allowing the state to appropriate many of the essential roles that the family has played for millennia, and reducing the incentive of all members of a family to invest in long‐term familial relations.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-2984" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2985">Substituting the family with government largesse has arguably been a losing trade for individuals who have partaken in it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2986">Several studies show that life satisfaction depends to a large degree on establishing intimate long‐term familial bonds with a partner and children.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-442" href="#calibre_link-423" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2987">14</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2988"> Many studies also show that rates of depression and psychological diseases are rising over time as the family breaks down, particularly for women.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-443" href="#calibre_link-424" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2989">15</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-2990"> Cases of depression and psychological disorders very frequently have family breakdown as a leading cause.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3000" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3001">The impact of sound money on time preference and future orientation can be seen in more than just the level of savings, but also in the type of projects in which a society invests. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3002">Under a sound money regime, similar to what the world had in the late nineteenth century, individuals are far more likely to engage in long‐term investments and to have large amounts of capital available to finance the sort of projects that will require a long time to pay off. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3003">As a result, some of the most important innovations in human history were born in the golden era at the end of the nineteenth century.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3004" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3005">In their seminal work, </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3006">The History of Science and Technology</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3007">, Bunch and Hellemans compile a list of the 8,583 most important innovations and inventions in the history of science and technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3008">Physicist Jonathan Huebner</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-445" href="#calibre_link-426" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3009">17</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3010"> analyzed all these events along with the years in which they happened and global population at that year, and measured the rate of occurrence of these events per year per capita since the Dark Ages. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3011">Huebner found that while the total number of innovations rose in the twentieth century, the number of innovations per capita peaked in the nineteenth century.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3012" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3013">A closer look at the innovations of the pre‐1914 world lends support to Huebner's data. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3014">It is no exaggeration to say that our modern world was invented in the gold standard years preceding World War I. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3015">The twentieth century was the century that refined, improved, optimized, economized, and popularized the inventions of the nineteenth century. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3016">The wonders of the twentieth century's improvements make it easy to forget that the actual inventions&mdash;the transformative world‐changing innovations&mdash;almost all came in the golden era.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3017" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3018">In his popular book, </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3019">From Zero to One</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3020">, Peter Thiel discusses the impact of the visionaries who create a new world by producing the first successful example of a new</span><span type="pagebreak" title="97" id="calibre_link-596" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3021"> technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3022">The move from having “zero to one” successful example of a technology, as he terms it, is the hardest and most significant step in an invention, whereas the move from “one to many” is a matter of scaling, marketing, and optimization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3023">Those of us who are enamored with the concept of progress might find it hard to swallow the fact that the world of sound money pre‐1914 was the world of zero to one, whereas the post‐1914 world of government‐produced money is the world of moving from one to many. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3024">There is nothing wrong with the move from one to many, but it certainly gives us plenty of food for thought to consider why we do not have many more zero‐to‐one transformations under our modern monetary system.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3025" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3026">The majority of the technology we use in our modern life was invented in the nineteenth century, under the gold standard, financed with the ever‐growing stock of capital accumulated by savers storing their wealth in a sound money and store of value which did not depreciate quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3027">A summary of some of the most important innovations of the period is provided here:</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3064" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3065">The contributions of sound money to human flourishing are not restricted to scientific and technological advance; they can also be vividly seen in the art world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3066">It is no coincidence that Florentine and Venetian artists were the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="99" id="calibre_link-597" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3067"> leaders of the Renaissance, as these were the two cities which led Europe in the adoption of sound money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3068">The Baroque, Neoclassical, Romantic, Realistic, and post‐Impressionistic schools were all financed by wealthy patrons holding sound money, with a very low time preference and the patience to wait for years, or even decades, for the completion of masterpieces meant to survive for centuries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3069">The astonishing domes of Europe's churches, built and decorated over decades of inspired meticulous work by incomparable architects and artists like Filippo Brunelleschi and Michelangelo, were all financed with sound money by patrons with very low time preference. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3070">The only way to impress these patrons was to build artwork that would last long enough to immortalize their names as the owners of great collections and patrons of great artists. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3071">This is why Florence's Medicis are perhaps better remembered for their patronage of the arts than for their innovations in banking and finance, though the latter may be far more consequential.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3072" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3073">Similarly, the musical works of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and the composers of the Renaissance, Classical, and Romantic eras put to shame today's animalistic noises recorded in batches of a few minutes, churned out by the ton by studios profiting from selling to man the titillation of his basest instincts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3074">Whereas the music of the golden era spoke to man's soul and awakened him to think of higher callings than the mundane grind of daily life, today's musical noises speak to man's most base animalistic instincts, distracting him from the realities of life by inviting him to indulge in immediate sensory pleasures with no concern for long‐term consequences or anything more profound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3075">It was hard money that financed Bach's </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3076">Brandenburg Concertos</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3077"> while easy money financed Miley Cyrus's twerks.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3078" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3079">In times of sound money and low time preference, artists worked on perfecting their craft so they could produce valuable works in the long run. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3080">They spent years learning the intricate details and techniques of their work, perfecting it and excelling in developing it beyond the capabilities of others, to the astonishment of their patrons and the general public. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3081">Nobody stood a chance of being called an artist without years of hard work on developing their craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3082">Artists did not condescendingly lecture the public on what art is and why their lazy productions that took a day to make are profound. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3083">Bach never claimed to be a genius or spoke at length about how his</span><span type="pagebreak" title="100" id="calibre_link-314" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3084"> music was better than that of others; he instead spent his life perfecting his craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3085">Michelangelo spent four years hanging from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel working for most of the day with little food in order to paint his masterpiece. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3086">He even wrote a poem to describe the ordeal:</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-446" href="#calibre_link-427" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3087">18</span></a></sup></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3128" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3129">Only with such meticulous and dedicated effort over many decades did these geniuses succeed in producing these masterpieces, immortalizing their names as the masters of their craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3130">In the era of unsound money, no artist has the low time preference to work as hard or as long as Michelangelo or Bach to learn their craft properly or spend any significant amount of time perfecting it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3131">A stroll through a modern art gallery shows artistic works whose production requires no more effort or talent than can be mustered by a bored 6‐year‐old. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3132">Modern artists have replaced craft and long hours</span><span type="pagebreak" title="101" id="calibre_link-598" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3133"> of practice with pretentiousness, shock value, indignation, and existential angst as ways to cow audiences into appreciating their art, and often added some pretense to political ideals, usually of the puerile Marxist variety, to pretend‐play profundity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3134">To the extent that anything good can be said about modern “art,” it is that it is clever, in the manner of a prank or practical joke. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3135">There is nothing beautiful or admirable about the output or the process of most modern art, because it was produced in a matter of hours by lazy talentless hacks who never bothered to practice their craft. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3136">Only cheap pretentiousness, obscenity, and shock value attract attention to the naked emperor of modern art, and only long pretentious diatribes shaming others for not understanding the work give it value.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3137" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3138">As government money has replaced sound money, patrons with low time preference and refined tastes have been replaced by government bureaucrats with political agendas as crude as their artistic taste. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3139">Naturally, then, neither beauty nor longevity matters anymore, replaced with political prattling and the ability to impress bureaucrats who control the major funding sources to the large galleries and museums, which have become a government‐protected monopoly on artistic taste and standards for artistic education. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3140">Free competition between artists and donors is now replaced with central planning by unaccountable bureaucrats, with predictably disastrous results. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3141">In free markets, the winners are always the ones who provide the goods deemed best by the public. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3142">When government is in charge of deciding winners and losers, the sort of people who have nothing better to do with their life than work as government bureaucrats are the arbiters of taste and beauty. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3143">Instead of art's success being determined by the people who have succeeded in attaining wealth through several generations of intelligence and low time preference, it is instead determined by the people with the opportunism to rise in the political and bureaucratic system best. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3144">A passing familiarity with this kind of people is enough to explain to anyone how we can end up with the monstrosities of today's art.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3145" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3146">In their fiat‐fueled ever‐growing realm of control, almost all modern governments dedicate budgets to finance art and artists in various media. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3147">But as time has gone by, bizarre and barely believable stories have emerged about covert government meddling in arts for political agendas. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3148">While the Soviets funded and directed communist “art” to achieve political and propaganda</span><span type="pagebreak" title="102" id="calibre_link-328" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3149"> goals, it has recently emerged that the CIA retorted by financing and promoting the work of abstract expressionist mattress and cardboard molesters such as Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock to serve as an American counter.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-447" href="#calibre_link-428" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3150">19</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3151"> Only with unsound money could we have reached this artistic calamity where the two largest economic, military, and political behemoths in the world were actively promoting and funding tasteless trash picked by people whose artistic tastes qualify them for careers in Washington and Moscow spy agencies and bureaucracies.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3152" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3153">As the Medicis have been replaced with the artistic equivalents of DMV workers, the result is an art world teeming with visually repulsive garbage produced in a matter of minutes by lazy talentless hacks looking for a quick paycheck by scamming the world's aspirants to artistic class with concocted nonsensical stories about it symbolizing anything more than the utter depravity of the scoundrel pretending to be an artist who made it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3154">Mark Rothko's “art” took mere hours to produce, but was sold to gullible collectors holding millions of today's unsound money, clearly solidifying modern art as the most lucrative get‐rich‐quick scam of our age. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3155">No talent, hard work, or effort is required on the part of a modern artist, just a straight face and a snobby attitude when recounting to the nouveau riche why the splatter of paint on a canvas is anything more than a hideous thoughtless splatter of paint, and how their inability to understand the work of art unexplained can be easily remedied with a fat check.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3156" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3157">What is astounding is not just the preponderance of garbage like Rothko's in the modern art world; it is the conspicuous absence of great masterpieces that can compare with the great works of the past. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3158">One cannot help but notice that there aren't too many Sistine Chapels being constructed today anywhere; nor are there many masterpieces to compare with the great paintings of Leonardo, Rafael, Rembrandt, Carvaggio, or Vermeer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3159">This is even more astonishing when one realizes that advances in technology and industrialization would make producing such artwork far easier to accomplish than it was in the golden era.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3160" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3161">The Sistine Chapel will</span><span type="pagebreak" title="103" id="calibre_link-599" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3162"> leave its viewer in awe, and any further explanation of its content, method, and history will transform the awe into appreciation of the depth of thought, craft, and hard work that went into it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3163">Before they became famous, even the most pretentious of art critics could have passed by a Rothko painting neglected on a sidewalk and not even noticed it, let alone bothered to pick it up and take it home. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3164">Only after a circle jerk of critics have spent endless hours pontificating to promote this work will the hangers‐on and aspirant nouveau riche begin to pretend there is deeper meaning to it and spend modern unsound money on it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3165" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3166">Several stories have surfaced over the years of pranksters leaving random objects in modern art museums, only for modern art lovers to swarm around them in admiration, illustrating the utter vacuity of our era's artistic tastes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3167">But there is perhaps no more fitting tribute to the value of modern art than the many janitors at art exhibits worldwide who, demonstrating admirable perceptiveness and dedication to their job, have repeatedly thrown expensive modern art installations into the dustbins to which they belong. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3168">Some of the most iconic “artists” of our era, such as Damien Hirst, Gustav Metzger, Tracey Emin, and Italian duo Sara Goldschmied and Eleonora Chiara, have received this critical appraisal by janitors more discerning than the insecure nouveau riche who spent millions of dollars on what the janitors threw away.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3169" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3170">A case can be made for ignoring all this worthless scribbling as just a government‐funded embarrassment to our era and looking beyond it for what is worthwhile. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3171">Nobody, after all, would judge a country like America by the behavior of its incompetent DMV employees napping on their shifts as they take out their frustrations on their hapless customers, and perhaps we shouldn't judge our era by the work of government workers spinning stories about piles of worthless cardboard as if they were artistic achievements. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3172">But even then, we find less and less that can hold a candle to the past. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3173">In </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3174">From Dawn to Decadence</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3175">, a devastating critique of modern “demotic” culture, Jacques Barzun concludes: “All that the 20C has contributed and created since is refinement by ANALYSIS or criticism by pastiche and parody.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3176">Barzun's work has resonated with many of this generation because it contains a large degree of depressing truth: once one overcomes one's inherent bias to believe in the inevitability of progress, there is no escaping the conclusion that ours is a generation that is inferior to its ancestors</span><span type="pagebreak" title="104" id="calibre_link-176" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3177"> in culture and refinement, in the same way the Roman subjects of Diocletian, living off his inflationary spending and drunk on the barbaric spectacles of the Colosseum, could not hold a candle to the great Romans of Caesar's era, who had to earn their aureus coins with sober hard work.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3306" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3307">Hayek explained that contrary to popular and elementary treatments of the topic, the economic problem is not merely the problem of allocating resources and products, but more accurately, the problem of allocating them using knowledge that is not given in its totality to any single individual or entity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3308">Economic knowledge of the conditions of production, the relative availability and abundance of the factors of production, and the preferences of individuals, is not objective knowledge that can be fully known to a single entity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3309">Rather, the knowledge of economic conditions is by its very nature </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3310">distributed</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3311"> and situated with the people concerned by their individual decisions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3312">Every human's mind is consumed in learning and understanding the economic information relevant to them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3313">Highly intelligent and hardworking individuals will spend decades learning the economic realities of their industries in order to reach positions of authority over the production processes of one single good. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3314">It is inconceivable that all these individual decisions being carried out by everyone could be substituted by aggregating all that information into one individual's mind to perform the calculations for everyone. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3315">Nor is there a need for this insane quest to centralize all knowledge into one decision maker's hands.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3316" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3317">In a free market economic system, prices are knowledge, and the signals that communicate information. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3318">Each individual decision maker is only able to carry out her decisions by examining the prices of the goods involved, which carry in them the distillation of all market conditions and realities into one actionable variable for that individual. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3319">In turn, each individual's decisions will</span><span type="pagebreak" title="107" id="calibre_link-284" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3320"> in turn play a role in shaping the price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3321">No central authority could ever internalize all the information that goes into forming a price or replace its function.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3322" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3323">To understand Hayek's point, picture the scenario of an earthquake badly damaging the infrastructure of a country that is the world's major producer of a commodity, such as the 2010 earthquake in Chile, which is the world's largest producer of copper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3324">As the earthquake hit a region with extensive copper mines, it caused damage to these mines and to the seaport from which they are exported. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3325">This meant a reduction in the supply of copper to the world markets and immediately resulted in a 6.2% rise in the price of copper.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-749" href="#calibre_link-726" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3326">1</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3327"> Anybody in the world involved in the copper market will be affected by this, but they do not need to know anything about the earthquake, Chile, and the conditions of the market in order to decide how to act. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3328">The rise in the price itself contains all the relevant information they need. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3329">Immediately, all the firms demanding copper now have an incentive to demand a smaller quantity of it, delay purchases that weren't immediately necessary, and find substitutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3330">On the other hand, the rising price gives all firms that produce copper anywhere around the world an incentive to produce more of it, to capitalize on the price rise.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3331" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3332">With the simple increase in the price, everyone involved in the copper industry around the world now has the incentive to act in a way that alleviates the negative consequences of the earthquake: other producers supply more while consumers demand less. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3333">As a result, the shortage caused by the earthquake is not as devastating as it could be, and the extra revenue from the rising prices can help the miners rebuild their infrastructure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3334">Within a few days, the price was back to normal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3335">As global markets have become more integrated and larger, such individual disruptions are becoming less impactful than ever, as market makers have the depth and liquidity to get around them quickly with the least disruption.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3336" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3337">To understand the power of prices as a method of communicating knowledge, imagine that the day before the earthquake, the entirety of the global copper industry stopped being a market institution and was instead given over to be under the command of a specialized agency, meaning production is allocated without</span><span type="pagebreak" title="108" id="calibre_link-222" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3338"> any recourse to prices. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3339">How would such an agency react to the earthquake? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3340">Of all the many copper producers worldwide, how would they decide which producers should increase their production and by how much? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3341">In a price system, each firm's own management will look at the prices of copper and the prices of all inputs into its production and come up with an answer to the most efficient new level of production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3342">Many professionals work for decades in a firm to arrive at these answers with the help of prices, and they know their own firm far more than the central planners, who cannot resort to prices. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3343">Further, how will the planners decide on which consumers of copper should reduce their consumption and by how much, when there are no prices allowing these consumers to reveal their preferences?</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3344" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3345">No matter how much objective data and knowledge the agency might collect, it can never know all the dispersed knowledge that bears on the decisions that each individual carries out, and that includes their own preferences and valuations of objects. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3346">Prices, then, are not simply a tool to allow capitalists to profit; they are the information system of economic production, communicating knowledge across the world and coordinating the complex processes of production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3347">Any economic system that tries to dispense with prices will cause the complete breakdown of economic activity and bring a human society back to a primitive state.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3348" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3349">Prices are the only mechanism that allows trade and specialization to occur in a market economy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3350">Without resort to prices humans could not benefit from the division of labor and specialization beyond some very primitive small scale. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3351">Trade allows producers to increase their living standards through specialization in the goods in which they have a </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3352">comparative advantage</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3353">&mdash;goods which they can produce at a lower relative cost. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3354">Only with accurate prices expressed in a common medium of exchange is it possible for people to identify their comparative advantage and specialize in it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3355">Specialization itself, guided by price signals, will lead to producers further improving their efficiency in the production of these goods through learning by doing, and more importantly, accumulating capital specific to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3356">In fact, even without inherent differences in the relative costs, specialization would allow each producer to accumulate capital relevant to their production and thus increase their marginal productivity in it, allowing them to decrease their marginal cost of production, and trade with those who accumulate capital to specialize in other goods.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-3359" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3360">While most understand the importance</span><span type="pagebreak" title="109" id="calibre_link-201" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3361"> of the price system to the division of labor, few get the crucial role it plays in capital accumulation and allocation, for which we need to turn to the work of Mises. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3362">In his 1922 book, </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3363">Socialism</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3364">, Mises explained the quintessential reason why socialist systems must fail, and it was </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3365">not</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3366"> the commonly held idea that socialism simply had an incentive problem (Why would anyone work if everyone got the same rewards regardless of effort?). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3367">Given that lack of application to one's job was usually punished with government murder or imprisonment, socialism arguably overcame the incentive problem successfully, regardless of how bloody the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3368">After a century in which around 100 million people worldwide were murdered by socialist regimes,</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-750" href="#calibre_link-727" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3369">2</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3370"> this punishment was clearly not theoretical, and the incentives to work were probably stronger than in a capitalist system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3371">There must be more to socialist failure than just incentives, and Mises was the first to precisely explicate why socialism would fail even if it were to successfully overcome the incentive problem by creating “the new socialist man.”</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3372" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3373">The fatal flaw of socialism that Mises exposed was that without a price mechanism emerging on a free market, socialism would fail at economic calculation, most crucially in the allocation of capital goods</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-751" href="#calibre_link-728" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3374">3</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3375">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3376">As discussed earlier, capital production involves progressively sophisticated methods of production, longer time horizons, and a larger number of intermediate goods not consumed for their own sake, but only produced so as to take part in the production of final consumer goods in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3377">Sophisticated structures of production only emerge from an intricate web of individual calculations by producers of each capital and consumer good buying and selling inputs and outputs to one another</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-752" href="#calibre_link-729" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3378">4</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3379">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3380">The most productive allocation is determined only through the price mechanism allowing the most productive users of capital goods to bid highest for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3381">The supply and demand</span><span type="pagebreak" title="110" id="calibre_link-340" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3382"> of capital goods emerges from the interaction of the producers and consumers and their iterative decisions.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3383" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3384">In a socialist system, government owns and controls the means of production, making it at once the sole buyer and seller of all capital goods in the economy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3385">That centralization stifles the functioning of an actual market, making sound decisions based on prices impossible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3386">Without a market for capital where independent actors can bid for capital, there can be no price for capital overall or for individual capital goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3387">Without prices of capital goods reflecting their relative supply and demand, there is no rational way of determining the most productive uses of capital, nor is there a rational way of determining how much to produce of each capital good. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3388">In a world in which the government owns the steel factory, as well as all the factories that will utilize steel in the production of various consumer and capital goods, there can be no price emerging for steel, or for the goods it is used to produce, and hence, no possible way of knowing which uses of steel are the most important and valuable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3389">How can the government determine whether its limited quantities of steel should be utilized in making cars or trains, given that it also owns the car and train factories and allocates by diktat to citizens how many cars and trains they can have? </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3390">Without a price system for citizens to decide between trains and cars, there is no way of knowing what the optimal allocation is and no way of knowing where the steel would be most necessary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3391">Asking citizens in surveys is a meaningless exercise, because people's choices are meaningless without a price to reflect the real opportunity cost involved in trade‐offs between choices. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3392">A survey without prices would find that everyone would like their own Ferrari, but of course, when people have to pay, very few choose Ferraris. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3393">Central planners can never know the preferences of each individual nor allocate resources in the way that satisfies that individual's needs best.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3394" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3395">Further, when the government owns all inputs into all the production processes of the economy, the absence of a price mechanism makes it virtually impossible to coordinate the production of various capital goods in the right quantities to allow all the factories to function. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3396">Scarcity is the starting point of all economics, and it is not possible to produce unlimited quantities of all inputs; trade‐offs need to be made, so allocating capital, land, and labor to the production of steel must come at the expense of creating more copper. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3397">In a free market, as factories compete for the acquisition of copper and steel, they</span><span type="pagebreak" title="111" id="calibre_link-203" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3398"> create scarcity and abundance in these markets and the prices allow copper and steel makers to compete for the resources that go into making them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3399">A central planner is completely in the dark about this web of preferences and opportunity costs, of trains, cars, copper, steel, labor, capital, and land. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3400">Without prices, there is no way to calculate how to allocate these resources to produce the optimal products, and the result is a complete breakdown in production.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3401" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3402">And yet all of this is but one aspect of the calculation problem, pertaining merely to the production of existing goods in a static market. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3403">The problem is far more pronounced when one considers that nothing is static in human affairs, as humans are eternally seeking to improve their economic situation, to produce new goods, and find more and better ways of producing goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3404">The ever‐present human impulse to tinker, improve, and innovate gives socialism its most intractable problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3405">Even if the central planning system succeeded in managing a static economy, it is powerless to accommodate change or to allow entrepreneurship. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3406">How can a socialist system make calculations for technologies and innovations that do not exist, and how can factors of production be allocated for them when there is yet no indication whether these products can even work?</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3420" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3421">The capital markets in a modern economy consist of the markets for loanable funds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3422">As the structure of production becomes more complicated and long‐term, individuals no longer invest their savings themselves, but lend them out, through various institutions, to businesses specialized in production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3423">The interest rate is the price that the lender receives for lending their funds, and the price that the borrower pays to obtain them.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3424" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3425">In a free market for loanable funds, the quantity of these funds supplied, like all supply curves, rises as the interest rate rises. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3426">In other words, the higher the interest rate, the more people are inclined to save and offer their savings to entrepreneurs and firms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3427">The demand for loans, on the other hand, is negatively related to the interest rate, meaning that entrepreneurs and firms will want to borrow less when the interest rate rises.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3428" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3429">The interest rate in a free market for capital is positive because people's positive time preference means that nobody would part with money unless he could receive more of it in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3430">A society with a lot of individuals with low time preference is likely to have plenty of savings, bringing the interest rate down and providing for plenty of capital for firms to invest, generating significant economic growth for the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3431">As a society's time preference increases, people are less likely to save, interest rates would be high, and producers find less capital to borrow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3432">Societies that live in peace and have secure property rights and a large degree of economic freedom are likely to have low time preference as they provide a strong incentive for individuals to discount their future less. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3433">Another Austrian economist, Eugen von Böhm‐Bawerk, even argued that the interest rate in a nation reflected its cultural level: the higher a people's intelligence and moral strength, the more they save and the lower the rate of interest.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3439" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3440">A fundamental fact to understand about the modern financial system is that banks create money whenever they engage in lending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3441">In a fractional reserve banking system similar to the one present all over the world today, banks not only lend the savings of their customers, but also their demand deposits. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3442">In other words, the depositor can call on the money at any time while a large percentage of that money has been issued as a loan to a borrower. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3443">By giving the money to the borrower while keeping it available to the depositor, the bank effectively creates new money and that results in an increase in the money supply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3444">This underlies the relationship between money supply and interest rates: when interest rates drop, there is an increase in lending, which leads to an increase in money creation and a rise in the money supply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3445">On the other hand, a rise in interest rates causes a reduction in lending and contraction in the money supply, or at least a reduction in the rate of its growth.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-3448" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3449">Whereas in a free market for capital the supply of loanable funds is determined by the market participants who decide to lend based on the interest rate, in an economy with a central bank and fractional reserve banking, the supply of loanable funds is directed by a committee of economists under the influence of politicians, bankers, TV pundits, and sometimes, most spectacularly, military generals.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3450" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3451">Any passing familiarity with economics will make the dangers of price controls clear and discernable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3452">Should a government decide to set the price of apples and prevent it from</span><span type="pagebreak" title="114" id="calibre_link-338" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3453"> moving, the outcome will be either a shortage or a surplus and large losses to society overall from overproduction or underproduction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3454">In the capital markets, something similar happens, but the effects are far more devastating as they affect every sector of the economy, because capital is involved in the production of every economic good.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3455" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3456">It is first important to understand the distinction between loanable funds and actual capital goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3457">In a free market economy with sound money, savers have to defer consumption in order to save. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3458">Money that is deposited in a bank as savings is money taken away from consumption by people who are delaying the gratification that consumption could give them in order to gain more gratification in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3459">The exact amount of savings becomes the exact amount of loanable funds available for producers to borrow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3460">The availability of capital goods is inextricably linked to the reduction of consumption: actual physical resources, labor, land, and capital goods will move from being employed in the provision of final consumption goods to the production of capital goods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3461">The marginal worker is directed away from car sales and toward a job in the car factory; the proverbial corn seed will go into the ground instead of being eaten.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3462" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3463">Scarcity is the fundamental starting point of all economics, and its most important implication is the notion that everything has an opportunity cost. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3464">In the capital market, the opportunity cost of capital is forgone consumption, and the opportunity cost of consumption is forgone capital investment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3465">The interest rate is the price that regulates this relationship: as people demand more investments, the interest rate rises, incentivizing more savers to set aside more of their money for savings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3466">As the interest rate drops, it incentivizes investors to engage in more investments, and to invest in more technologically advanced methods of production with a longer time horizon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3467">A lower interest rate, then, allows for the engagement of methods of production that are longer and more productive: society moves from fishing with rods to fishing with oil‐powered large boats.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3468" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3469">As an economy advances and becomes increasingly sophisticated, the connection between physical capital and the loanable funds market does not change in reality, but it does get obfuscated in the minds of people. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3470">A modern economy with a central bank is built on ignoring this fundamental trade‐off and assuming that</span><span type="pagebreak" title="115" id="calibre_link-357" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3471"> banks can finance investment with new money without consumers having to forgo consumption. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3472">The link between savings and loanable funds is severed to the point where it is not even taught in the economics textbooks any more,</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-755" href="#calibre_link-732" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3473">7</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3474"> let alone the disastrous consequences of ignoring it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3475" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3476">As the central bank manages the money supply and interest rate, there will inevitably be a discrepancy between savings and loanable funds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3477">Central banks are generally trying to spur economic growth and investment and to increase consumption, so they tend to increase the money supply and lower the interest rate, resulting in a larger quantity of loanable funds than savings. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3478">At these artificially low interest rates, businesses take on more debt to start projects than savers put aside to finance these investments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3479">In other words, the value of consumption deferred is less than the value of the capital borrowed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3480">Without enough consumption deferred, there will not be enough capital, land, and labor resources diverted away from consumption goods toward higher‐order capital goods at the earliest stages of production. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3481">There is no free lunch, after all, and if consumers save less, there will have to be less capital available for investors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3482">Creating new pieces of paper and digital entries to paper over the deficiency in savings does not magically increase society's physical capital stock; it only devalues the existing money supply and distorts prices.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3483" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3484">This shortage of capital is not immediately apparent, because banks and the central bank can issue enough money for the borrowers&mdash;that is, after all, the main perk of using unsound money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3485">In an economy with sound money, such manipulation of the price of capital would be impossible: as soon as the interest rate is set artificially low, the shortage in savings at banks is reflected in reduced capital available for borrowers, leading to a rise in the interest rate, which reduces demand for loans and raises the supply of savings until the two match.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3486" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3487">Unsound money makes such manipulation possible, but only for a short while, of course, as reality cannot be deceived forever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3488">The artificially low interest rates and the excess printed money deceive the producers into engaging in a production</span><span type="pagebreak" title="116" id="calibre_link-196" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3489"> process requiring more capital resources than is actually available. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3490">The excess money, backed by no actual deferred consumption, initially makes more producers borrow, operating under the delusion that the money will allow them to buy all the capital goods necessary for their production process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3491">As more and more producers are bidding for fewer capital goods and resources than they expect there to be, the natural outcome is a rise in the price of the capital goods during the production process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3492">This is the point at which the manipulation is exposed, leading to the simultaneous collapse of several capital investments which suddenly become unprofitable at the new capital good prices; these projects are what Mises termed </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3493">malinvestments</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3494">&mdash;investments that would not have been undertaken without the distortions in the capital market and whose completion is not possible once the misallocations are exposed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3495">The central bank's intervention in the capital market allows for more projects to be undertaken because of the distortion of prices that causes investors to miscalculate, but the central bank's intervention cannot increase the amount of actual capital available. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3496">So these extra projects are not completed and become an unnecessary waste of capital. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3497">The suspension of these projects at the same time causes a rise in unemployment across the economy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3498">This economy‐wide simultaneous failure of overextended businesses is what is referred to as a </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3499">recession</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3500">.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3722" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3723">The value of money, supposed to be the unit of account with which all economic activity is measured and planned, went from being the value of the least volatile good on the market to being determined through the sum of three policy tools of the government&mdash;monetary, fiscal, and trade policy&mdash;and most unpredictably, through the reactions of individuals to these policy tools. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3724">Governments deciding</span><span type="pagebreak" title="128" id="calibre_link-290" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3725"> to dictate the measure of value makes as much sense as governments attempting to dictate the measure of length based on the heights of individuals and buildings in their territories. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3726">One can only imagine the sort of confusion that would happen to all engineering projects were the length of the meter to oscillate daily with the pronouncements of a central measurements office.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3727" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3728">Only the vanity of the insane can be affected by changing the unit with which they're measured. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3729">Making the meter shorter might make someone whose house's area is 200 square meters believe it is actually 400 square meters, but it would still be the same house. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3730">All that this redefinition of the meter has caused is ruin an engineer's ability to properly build or maintain a house. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3731">Similarly, devaluing a currency may make a country richer nominally, or increase the nominal value of its exports, but it does nothing to make the country more prosperous.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3746" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3747">In a highly globalized world where foreign exchange rates are dependent upon a plethora of domestic and international variables, running a productive business becomes challenging completely unnecessarily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3748">A successful firm likely has inputs and outputs from its business come and go to multiple countries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3749">Every single purchase and sale decision is dependent on the foreign exchange between the countries involved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3750">In this world, a highly competitive firm could suffer high losses through nothing more than a shift in exchange rates, not even necessarily involving its own country. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3751">If the firm's major supplier's country witnesses a rise in the value of its currency, the firm's input costs could rise enough to destroy the firm's profitability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3752">The same thing could happen if the currency of the main market to which it exports drops in value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3753">Firms that have spent decades working on a competitive advantage could see it wiped out in 15 minutes of unpredictable foreign exchange volatility. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3754">This usually gets blamed on free trade, and economists and politicians likewise will use it as an excuse for implementing popular but destructive protectionist trade policies.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3773" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3774">In a free market for money, individuals would choose the currencies they want to use, and the result would be that they would choose the currency with the reliably lowest stock‐to‐flow ratio. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3775">This currency would oscillate the least with changes in demand and supply, and it would become a globally sought medium of exchange, allowing all economic calculation to be carried out with it, becoming a common unit of measure across time and space. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3776">The higher the salability of a good, the more suited it is for this role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3777">The Roman aureus, Byzantine solidus, or the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3778">dollar were all examples of this to a limited extent, though each had its drawbacks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3779">The money that</span><span type="pagebreak" title="131" id="calibre_link-259" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3780"> came closest to this was gold in the latter years of the international gold standard, although even then, some countries and societies remained on silver or other primitive forms of money.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3781" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3782">It is an astonishing fact of modern life that an entrepreneur in the year 1900 could make global economic plans and calculations all denominated in any international currency, with no thought whatsoever given to exchange rate fluctuations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3783">A century later, the equivalent entrepreneur trying to make an economic plan across borders faces an array of highly volatile exchange rates that might make him think he has walked into a Salvador Dali painting. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3784">Any sane analyst looking at this mess would conclude it would be best to just tie the value of money to gold again and be rid of this juggling act, thus solving the Impossible Trinity by eliminating the need for government‐controlled monetary policy, and having free capital movement and free trade. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3785">This would at once create economic stability and free up a large amount of capital and resources to the production of valuable goods and services, rather than speculation on complex exchange rate oscillations.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3786" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3787">Unfortunately, however, the people in charge of the current monetary system have a vested interest in it continuing, and have thus preferred to try to find ways to manage it, and to find ever‐more‐creative ways of vilifying and dismissing the gold standard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3788">This is entirely understandable given their jobs depend on a government having access to a printing press to reward them.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3789" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3790">The combination of floating exchange rates and Keynesian ideology has given our world the entirely modern phenomenon of currency wars: because Keynesian analysis says that increasing exports leads to an increase in GDP, and GDP is the holy grail of economic well‐being, it thus follows, in the mind of Keynesians, that anything that boosts exports is good. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3791">Because a devalued currency makes exports cheaper, any country facing an economic slowdown can boost its GDP and employment by devaluing its currency and increasing its exports.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3792" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3793">There are many things wrong with this worldview. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3794">Reducing the value of the currency does nothing to increase the competitiveness of the industries in real terms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3795">Instead, it only creates a one‐time discount on their outputs, thus offering them to foreigners at a lower price than locals, impoverishing locals and subsidizing</span><span type="pagebreak" title="132" id="calibre_link-603" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3796"> foreigners. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3797">It also makes all the country's assets cheaper for foreigners, allowing them to come in and purchase land, capital, and resources in the country at a discount. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3798">In a liberal economic order, there is nothing wrong with foreigners buying local assets, but in a Keynesian economic order, foreigners are actively subsidized to come buy the country at a discount. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3799">Further, economic history shows that the most successful economies of the postwar era, such as Germany, Japan, and Switzerland, grew their exports significantly as their currency continued to appreciate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3800">They did not need constant devaluation to make their exports grow; they developed a competitive advantage that made their products demanded globally, which in turn caused their currencies to appreciate compared to their trade partners, increasing the wealth of their population. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3801">It is counterproductive for the countries importing from them to think they can boost their exports by simply devaluing the currency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3802">They would be destroying their people's wealth by simply allowing foreigners to purchase it at a discount. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3803">It is no coincidence that the countries that have seen their currencies devalue the most in the postwar period were also the ones that suffered economic stagnation and decline.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3804" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3805">But even if all of these problems with devaluation as the route to prosperity were inaccurate, there is one simple reason why it cannot work, and that is: if it worked, and all countries tried it, all currencies would devalue and no single country would have an advantage over the others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3806">This brings us to the current state of affairs in the global economy, where most governments attempt to devalue their currencies in order to boost their exports, and all complain about one another's “unfair” manipulation of their currencies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3807">Effectively, each country is impoverishing its citizens in order to boost its exporters and raise GDP numbers, and complaining when other countries do the same. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3808">The economic ignorance is only matched by the mendacious hypocrisy of the politicians and economists parroting these lines. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3809">International economic summits are convened where world leaders try to negotiate each other's acceptable currency devaluation, making the value of the currency an issue of geopolitical importance.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3810" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3811">None of this would be necessary if only the world were to be based on a sound global monetary system that serves as a global unit of account and measure of value, allowing</span><span type="pagebreak" title="133" id="calibre_link-604" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3812"> producers and consumers worldwide to have an accurate assessment of their costs and revenues, separating economic profitability from government policy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3813">Hard money, by taking the question of supply out of the hands of governments and their economist‐propagandists, would force everyone to be productive to society instead of seeking to get rich through the fool's errand of monetary manipulation.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3938" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3939">The fundamental scam of modernity is the idea that government needs to manage the money supply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3940">It is an unquestioned starting assumption of all mainstream economic schools of thought and political parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3941">There isn't a shred of real‐world evidence to support this contention, and every attempt to manage the money supply has ended with economic disaster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3942">Money supply management is the problem masquerading as its solution; the triumph of emotional hope over hard‐headed reason; the root of all political free lunches sold to gullible voters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3943">It functions like a highly addictive and destructive drug, such as crystal meth or sugar: it causes a beautiful high at the beginning, fooling its victims into feeling invincible, but as soon as the effect subsides, the come‐down is devastating and has the victim begging for more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3944">This is when the hard choice needs to be made: either suffer the withdrawal effects of ceasing the addiction, or take another hit, delay the reckoning by a day, and sustain severe long‐term damage.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-3959" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3960">It's important to understand the different rationales for the two schools of thought in order to understand how they can both arrive at the same conclusion and be equally wrong. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3961">Keynes was a failed investor and statistician who never studied economics but was so well‐connected with the ruling class in Britain that the embarrassing drivel he wrote in his most famous book, </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3962">The General Theory of Employment, Money, and Interest</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3963">, was immediately elevated into the status of founding truths of macroeconomics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3964">His theory begins with the (completely unfounded and unwarranted) assumption that the most important metric in determining the state of the economy is the level of aggregate spending across society. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3965">When</span><span type="pagebreak" title="138" id="calibre_link-297" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3966"> society collectively spends a lot, the spending incentivizes producers to create more products, thus employing more workers and reaching full‐employment equilibrium. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3967">If spending rises too much, beyond the capacity of producers to keep up, it would lead to inflation and a rise in the overall price level. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3968">On the other hand, when society spends too little, producers reduce their production, firing workers and increasing unemployment, resulting in a recession.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3969" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3970">Recessions, for Keynes, are caused by abrupt reductions in the aggregate level of spending. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3971">Keynes was not very good with grasping the concept of causality and logical explanations, so he never quite bothered to explain </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3972">why</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3973"> it is that spending levels might suddenly drop, instead just coining another of his famous clumsy and utterly meaningless figures of speech to save him the hassle of an explanation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3974">He blamed it on the flagging of “animal spirits.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3975">To this day, nobody knows exactly what these animal spirits are or why they might suddenly flag, but that of course has only meant that an entire cottage industry of state‐funded economists have made a career out of attempting to explain them or finding real‐world data that can correlate to them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3976">This research has been very good for academic careers, but is of no value to anyone actually trying to understand business cycles. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3977">Put bluntly, pop psychology is no substitute for capital theory.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-139" href="#calibre_link-107" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3978">3</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3979" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3980">Freed from the restraint of having to find a cause of the recession, Keynes can then happily recommend the solution he is selling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3981">Whenever there is a recession, or a rise in the unemployment level, the cause is a drop in the aggregate level of spending and the solution is for the government to stimulate spending, which will in turn increase production and reduce unemployment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3982">There are three ways of stimulating aggregate spending: increasing the money supply, increasing government spending, or reducing taxes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3983">Reducing taxes is generally frowned upon by Keynesians. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3984">It is viewed as the least effective method, because people will not spend all the taxes they don't have to pay&mdash;some of that money will be saved, and Keynes absolutely detested saving. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3985">Saving would reduce spending, and reducing spending would be the worst thing imaginable for an economy seeking</span><span type="pagebreak" title="139" id="calibre_link-298" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3986"> recovery. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3987">It was government's role to impose high time preference on society by spending more or printing money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3988">Seeing as it is hard to raise taxes during a recession, government spending would effectively translate to increasing the money supply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3989">This, then, was the Keynesian Holy Grail: whenever the economy was not at full employment, an increase of the money supply would fix the problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3990">There is no point worrying about inflation, because as Keynes had “showed” (i.e., baselessly assumed) inflation only happens when spending is too high, and because unemployment is high, that means spending is too low. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3991">There may be consequences in the long run, but there was no point worrying about long‐term consequences, because “in the long run, we are all dead,”</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-140" href="#calibre_link-108" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3992">4</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3993"> as Keynes's most famous defense of high‐time‐preference libertine irresponsibility famously stated.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-3994" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3995">The Keynesian view of the economy is, of course, at complete odds with reality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3996">If Keynes's model had any truth to it, it would then necessarily follow that there can be no example of a society experiencing high inflation and high unemployment at the same time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3997">But this has in fact happened many times, most notably in the United States in the 1970s, when, in spite of the assurances of Keynesian economists to the contrary, and in spite of the entire U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3998">establishment, from President Nixon down to “free market economist” Milton Friedman, adopting the refrain, “We're all Keynesians now” as the government took it upon itself to eliminate unemployment with increased inflation, unemployment kept on rising as inflation soared, destroying the theory that there is a trade‐off between these two. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-3999">In any sane society, Keynes's ideas should have been removed from the economics textbooks and confined to the realm of academic comedy, but in a society where government controls academia to a very large degree, the textbooks continued to preach the Keynesian mantra that justified ever more money printing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4000">Having the ability to print money, literally and figuratively, increases</span><span type="pagebreak" title="140" id="calibre_link-232" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4001"> the power of any government, and any government looks for anything that gives it more power.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-4219" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4220">Sound money, then, enforced a measure of honesty and transparency on governments, restricting their rule to within what was desirable and tolerable to the population. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4221">It allowed for society‐wide honest accounting of costs and benefits of actions, as well as the economic responsibility necessary for any organization, individual, or living being to succeed in life: consumption must come after production.</span></p>

</span></p>
<blockquote class="calibre22">
<p id="calibre_link-4261" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4262">Nineteenth‐century State Socialism sprang from Bentham, free competition, etc., and is in some respects a clearer, in some respects a more muddled, version of just the same philosophy as underlies nineteenth‐century individualism. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4263">Both equally laid all their stress on freedom, the one negatively to avoid limitations on existing freedom, the other positively to destroy natural or acquired monopolies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4264">They are different reactions to the same intellectual atmosphere.</span></p></blockquote>
<p id="calibre_link-4265" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4266">Keynes's problem with socialism, then, is that its end goal was increasing individual freedom. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4267">For Keynes, the end goal should not be concerned with trivial issues like individual freedom, but for government to control aspects of the economy to his liking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4268">He outlines three main arenas where he views government's role to be vital: first, “the deliberate control of the currency and of credit by a central institution,” the belief that laid the groundwork for modern central banking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4269">Second, and relatedly, Keynes believed it was the role of the government to decide on “the scale on which it is desirable that the community as a whole should save, the scale on which these savings should go abroad in the form of foreign investments, and whether the present organization of the investment</span><span type="pagebreak" title="154" id="calibre_link-609" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4270"> market distributes savings along the most nationally productive channels. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4271">I do not think that these matters should be left entirely to the chances of private judgement and private profits, as they are at present.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4272">And finally, Keynes believed it was the role of the government to devise “a considered national policy about what size of population, whether larger or smaller than at present or the same, is most expedient. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4273">And having settled this policy, we must take steps to carry it into operation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4274">The time may arrive a little later when the community as a whole must pay attention to the innate quality as well as to the mere numbers of its future members.”</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-153" href="#calibre_link-125" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4275">17</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4276" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4277">In other words, the Keynesian conception of the state, from which came the modern central banking doctrines held widely by all central bankers, and which shape the vast majority of economic textbooks written worldwide, comes from a place of a man who wanted government direction of two important areas of life: first, the control of money, credit, saving, and investment decisions, which meant the totalitarian centralization of capital allocation and destruction of free individual enterprise, making individuals utterly dependent on government for their basic survival, and second, the control of population quantity and quality, which meant eugenics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4278">And unlike socialists, Keynes did not seek this level of control over individuals in order to enhance their freedom in the long run, but rather to develop a grander vision of society as he sees fit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4279">While socialists may have had the decency to at least pretend to want to enslave man for his own good, to free him in the future, Keynes wanted government enslavement for its own sake, as the ultimate end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4280">This may help explain why Murray Rothbard said, “There is only one good thing about Marx, at least he was not a Keynesian.”</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-154" href="#calibre_link-126" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4281">18</span></a></sup></p>

<p id="calibre_link-4459" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4460">The larger the firm, the easier it is for it to secure low‐interest funding, giving it a large advantage over smaller independent producers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4461">In a society where investment is financed from savings, a small mom‐and‐pop diner competes for customers and financing with a fast‐food giant on an equal footing: customers and investors have a free choice in allocating their money between the two industries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4462">The benefits of economies of scale are up against the benefits of the personal attention and relationship between cook and customer of the small diner, and the market test decides. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4463">But in a world where central banks allocate credit, the larger firm has an advantage in being able to secure funding at a low rate which its smaller competitors cannot get.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-164" href="#calibre_link-136" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4464">28</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4465"> This helps explain why large‐scale food producers proliferate so widely around the world, as their lower interest rates allow them higher margins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4466">The triumph of bland, mass‐produced junk food cannot be understood outside the great benefits that large scale affords to producers.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4467" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4468">In a world in which almost all firms are financed through central bank credit expansion, there can be no simple way of discerning which industries are growing because of the injection of bezzle steroids, but there are some telltale symptoms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4469">Any industry in which people complain about their asshole boss is likely part of the bezzle, because bosses can only really afford to be assholes in the economic fake reality of the bezzle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4470">In a productive firm offering valuable service to society, success depends on pleasing customers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4471">Workers are rewarded for how well they do that essential task, and bosses who mistreat their workers will either lose the workers to competitors or destroy their business quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4472">In an unproductive firm that does</span><span type="pagebreak" title="165" id="calibre_link-348" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4473"> not serve society and relies on bureaucratic largesse for its survival, there is no meaningful standard by which to reward or punish workers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4474">The bezzle can appear seductive from outside, thanks to the generous regular paychecks and the lack of actual work involved, but if there's one lesson economics teaches us, it is that there is no such a thing as a free lunch. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4475">Money being handed out to unproductive people will attract a lot of people who want to do these jobs, driving up the cost of doing these jobs in time and dignity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4476">Hiring, firing, promotion, and punishment all happen at the discretion of layer upon layer of bureaucrats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4477">No work is valuable to the firm, everyone is dispensable, and the only way anyone maintains a job is by proving valuable to the layer above him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4478">A job in these firms is a full‐time game of office politics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4479">Such jobs are only appealing to shallow materialistic people who enjoy having power over others, and years of being maltreated are endured for the paycheck and the hope of being able to inflict this maltreatment on others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4480">It is no wonder that people who work these jobs are regularly depressed and in need of constant medication and psychotherapy to maintain basic functionality. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4481">No amount of bezzle money is worth the spiritual destruction that such an environment creates in people. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4482">While these organizations face no real accountability, the flipside of having no productivity is that it is quite possible for a newly elected official to come into office and completely defund them out of existence in a matter of weeks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4483">This is a far more tragic fate for the workers in these organizations as they generally have no useful skills whatsoever that can be transferred to other avenues of work.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4484" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4485">The only cure that can work for these pathologies is sound money, which will eradicate the notion of people working for the sake of ticking boxes and pleasing sadistic bosses, and make market discipline the only arbiter for anyone's income. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4486">If you find yourself toiling away in one of these industries, where the stress of your job centers purely on pleasing your boss rather than producing something of value, and are not happy with this reality, you may be relieved or frightened to realize the world doesn't have to be this way, and your job may not survive forever, as your government's printing press might not continue working forever. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4487">Read on, because the virtues of sound money may inspire a new world of opportunity for you.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-4681" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4682">To understand the significance of a technology for digital cash, it is instructive to look at the world before Bitcoin was invented, when one could neatly divide payment methods into</span><span type="pagebreak" title="169" id="calibre_link-207" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4683"> two distinct non‐overlapping categories:</span></p>
<ol class="calibre8">
<li id="calibre_link-4684" class="calibre29"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4685">Cash payments, which are carried out in person between two parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4686">These payments have the convenience of being immediate and final, and require no trust on the part of either transacting party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4687">There is no delay in the execution of the payment, and no third party can effectively intervene to stop such payments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4688">Their main drawback is the need for the two parties to be physically present in the same place at the same time, a problem which becomes more and more pronounced as telecommunication makes it more likely for individuals to want to transact with persons who are not in their immediate vicinity.</span></li>
<li id="calibre_link-4689" class="calibre29"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4690">Intermediated payments, which require a trusted third party, and comprise cheques, credit cards, debit cards, bank wire transfers, money transfer services, and more recent innovations such as PayPal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4691">By definition, intermediated payment involves a third party handling the money transfer between the two transacting parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4692">The main advantages of intermediated payments are allowing payments without the two parties having to be at the same place at the same time, and allowing the payer to make payment without having to carry her money on her. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4693">Their main drawback is the trust that is required in execution of the transactions, the risk of the third party being compromised, and the costs and time required for the payment to be completed and cleared to allow the recipient to spend it.</span></li></ol>
<p id="calibre_link-4694" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4695">Both forms of payment have their advantages and drawbacks, and most people resort to a combination of the two in their economic transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4696">Before the invention of Bitcoin, intermediated payments included (though were not limited to) all forms of digital payment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4697">The nature of digital objects, since the inception of computers, is that they are not scarce. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4698">They can be reproduced endlessly, and as such it was impossible to make a currency out of them, because sending them will only duplicate them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4699">Any form of electronic payment had to be carried out via an intermediary because of the danger of double‐spending: there was no way of guaranteeing that the payer was being honest with his funds, and not using them more than once, unless there was a trusted third party overseeing the account and able</span><span type="pagebreak" title="170" id="calibre_link-239" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4700"> to verify the integrity of the payments carried out. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4701">Cash transactions were confined to the physical realm of direct contact, while all digital forms of payments had to be supervised by a third party.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4702" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4703">After years of innovative trial and error by many programmers, and through relying on a wide range of technologies, Bitcoin was the first engineering solution that allowed for digital payments without having to rely on a trusted third‐party intermediary. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4704">By being the first digital object that is verifiably scarce, Bitcoin is the first example of </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4705">digital cash</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4706">.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4707" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4708">There are several drawbacks to transacting through trusted third parties which make digital cash a valuable proposition for many. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4709">Third parties are by their very nature an added security weakness</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-497" href="#calibre_link-460" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4710">1</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4711">&mdash;involving an extra party in your transaction inherently introduces risk, because it opens up new possibilities for theft or technical failure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4712">Further, payment through intermediaries leaves the parties vulnerable to surveillance and bans by political authorities. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4713">In other words, when resorting to any form of digital payment, there was no alternative to trusting in a third party, and whichever political authorities rule over it, and being subject to the risk of the political authority stopping the payment under pretexts of security, terrorism, or money laundering. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4714">To make matters worse, intermediated payments always involve a risk of fraud, which raises transaction costs and delays final settlement of payments.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4715" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4716">In other words, intermediated payments take away a significant share of the properties of money as a medium of exchange controlled by its owner, with high liquidity for him to sell whenever he wants. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4717">Of the most persistent characteristics of money historically are fungibility (any unit of money is equivalent to any other unit), and liquidity (ability of the owner to sell quickly at market price). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4718">People choose moneys that are fungible and liquid because they want sovereignty over their money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4719">Sovereign money contains within it all the permission needed to spend it; the desire for others to hold it exceeds the ability of others to impose controls on it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4720" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4721">While intermediated payments compromise some of the desirable features of money, these shortcomings are not present in physical cash transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4722">But as more trade and</span><span type="pagebreak" title="171" id="calibre_link-208" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4723"> employment takes place over long distances thanks to modern telecommunication, physical cash transactions become prohibitively impractical. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4724">The move toward digital payments was reducing the amount of sovereignty people have over their own money and leaving them subject to the whims of the third parties they had no choice but to trust. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4725">Further, the move from gold, which is money that nobody can print, toward fiat currencies whose supply is controlled by central banks further reduced people's sovereignty over their wealth and left them helpless in the face of the slow erosion of the value of their money as central banks inflated the money supply to fund government operation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4726">It became increasingly impractical to accumulate capital and wealth without the permission of the government issuing that money.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4727" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4728">Satoshi Nakamoto's motivation for Bitcoin was to create a “purely peer‐to‐peer form of electronic cash” that would not require trust in third parties for transactions and whose supply cannot be altered by any other party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4729">In other words, Bitcoin would bring the desirable features of physical cash (lack of intermediaries, finality of transactions) to the digital realm and combine them with an ironclad monetary policy that cannot be manipulated to produce unexpected inflation to benefit an outside party at the expense of holders. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4730">Nakamoto succeeded in achieving this through the utilization of a few important though not widely understood technologies: a distributed peer‐to‐peer network with no single point of failure, hashing, digital signatures, and proof‐of‐work.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-498" href="#calibre_link-461" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4731">2</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4732" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4733">Nakamoto removed the need for trust in a third party by building Bitcoin on a foundation of very thorough and ironclad </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4734">proof</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4735"> and </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4736">verification</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4737">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4738">It is fair to say that the central operational feature of Bitcoin is verification, and only because of that can Bitcoin remove the need for trust completely.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-499" href="#calibre_link-462" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4739">3</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4740"> Every transaction has to be recorded by every member of the network so that they all share one common ledger of balances and transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4741">Whenever a member of the network transfers a sum to another member, all network members can verify the sender has a sufficient balance, and nodes compete to be the first to update the ledger with a new block</span><span type="pagebreak" title="172" id="calibre_link-322" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4742"> of transactions every ten minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4743">In order for a node to commit a block of transactions to the ledger, it has to expend processing power on solving complicated mathematical problems that are hard to solve but whose correct solution is easy to verify. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4744">This is the proof‐of‐work (PoW) system, and only with a correct solution can a block be committed and verified by all network members. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4745">While these mathematical problems are unrelated to the Bitcoin transactions, they are indispensable to the operation of the system as they force the verifying nodes to expend processing power which would be wasted if they included fraudulent transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4746">Once a node solves the proof‐of‐work correctly and announces the transactions, other nodes on the network vote for its validity, and once a majority has voted to approve the block, nodes begin committing transactions to a new block to be amended to the previous one and solving the new proof‐of‐work for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4747">Crucially, the node that commits a valid block of transactions to the network receives a </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4748">block reward</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4749"> consisting of brand‐new bitcoins added to the supply along with all the transaction fees paid by the people who are transacting.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4750" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4751">This process is what is referred to as </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4752">mining</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4753">, analogous to the mining of precious metals, and is why nodes that solve proof‐of‐work are known as miners. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4754">This block reward compensates the miners for the resources they committed to proof‐of‐work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4755">Whereas in a modern central bank the new money created goes to finance lending and government spending, in Bitcoin the new money goes only to those who spend resources on updating the ledger. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4756">Nakamoto programmed Bitcoin to produce a new block roughly every ten minutes, and for each block to contain a reward of 50 coins in the first four years of Bitcoin's operation, to be halved afterwards to 25 coins, and further halved every four years.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4757" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4758">The quantity of bitcoins created is preprogrammed and cannot be altered no matter how much effort and energy is expended on proof‐of‐work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4759">This is achieved through a process called difficulty adjustment, which is perhaps the most ingenious aspect of Bitcoin's design. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4760">As more people choose to hold Bitcoin, this drives up the market value of Bitcoin and makes mining new coins more profitable, which drives more miners to expend more resources on solving proof‐of‐work problems. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4761">More miners means more processing power, which would result in the solutions to the proof‐of‐work being arrived at faster, thus increasing the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="173" id="calibre_link-614" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4762"> rate of issuance of new bitcoins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4763">But as the processing power rises, Bitcoin will raise the difficulty of the mathematical problems needed to unlock the mining rewards to ensure blocks will continue to take around ten minutes to be produced.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4764" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4765">Difficulty adjustment is the most reliable technology for making hard money and limiting the stock‐to‐flow ratio from rising, and it makes Bitcoin fundamentally different from every other money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4766">Whereas the rise in value of any money leads to more resources dedicated to its production and thus an increase in its supply, as Bitcoin's value rises, more effort to produce bitcoins does not lead to the production of more bitcoins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4767">Instead, it just leads to an increase in the processing power necessary to commit valid transactions to the Bitcoin network, which only serves to make the network more secure and difficult to compromise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4768">Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented: growth in its value cannot possibly increase its supply; it can only make the network more secure and immune to attack.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-4769" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4770">For every other money, as its value rises, those who can produce it will start producing more of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4771">Whether it is Rai stones, seashells, silver, gold, copper, or government money, everyone will have an incentive to try to produce more. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4772">The harder it was to produce new quantities of the money in response to price rises, the more likely it was to be adopted widely and used, and the more a society would prosper because it would mean individuals' efforts at producing wealth will go toward serving one another, not producing money, an activity with no added value to society because any supply of money is enough to run any economy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4773">Gold became the prime money of every civilized society precisely because it was the hardest to produce, but Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment makes it even harder to produce. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-4774">A massive increase in the price of gold will, in the long run, lead to larger quantities being produced, but no matter how high the price of bitcoins rises, the supply stays the same and the safety of the network only increases.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-5260" class="calibre13"><b class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5261">Public key cryptography</span></b><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5262"> is a method for authentication that relies on a set of mathematically related numbers: a private key, a public key, and one or more signatures. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5263">The private key, which must be kept secret, can generate a public key that can be distributed freely because it is not possible to determine the private key by examining the public key. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5264">This method is used for authentication: after someone publicizes his public key, he can hash some data and then</span><span type="pagebreak" title="192" id="calibre_link-321" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5265"> sign that hash with his private key to create a signature. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5266">Anyone with the same data can create the same hash and see that it was used to create the signature; then she can compare the signature to the public key she previously received and see that they're both mathematically related, proving that the person with the private key signed the data covered by the hash. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5267">Bitcoin utilizes public key cryptography to allow secure value exchange over an open unsecured network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5268">A bitcoin holder can only access his bitcoins if he has the private keys attached to them, while the public address associated with them can be distributed widely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5269">All network members can verify the validity of the transaction by verifying that the transactions sending the money came from the owner of the right private key. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5270">In Bitcoin, the only form of ownership that exists is through the ownership of the private keys.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5271" class="calibre13"><b class="calibre4"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5272">Peer‐to‐peer network</span></b><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5273"> is a network structure in which all members have equal privileges and obligations toward one another. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5274">There are no central coordinators who can change the rules of the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5275">Node operators that disagree with how the network functions cannot impose their opinions on other members of the network or override their privileges. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5276">The most well‐known example of a peer‐to‐peer network is BitTorrent, a protocol for sharing files online. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5277">Whereas in centralized networks members download files from a central server that hosts them, in BitTorrent, users download files from each other directly, divided into small pieces. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5278">Once a user has downloaded a piece of the file, they can become a seed for that file, allowing others to download it from them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5279">With this design, a large file can spread relatively quickly without the need for large servers and extensive infrastructure to distribute it, while also protecting against the possibility of a single point of failure compromising the process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5280">Every file that is shared on the network is protected by a cryptographic hash that can be easily verified to ensure that any nodes sharing it have not corrupted it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5281">After law enforcement had cracked down on centralized file‐sharing websites such as Napster, BitTorrent's decentralized nature meant law enforcement could never shut it down. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5282">With a growing network of users worldwide, BitTorrent at some point represented about a third of all Internet traffic worldwide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5283">Bitcoin utilizes a network similar to BitTorrent, but whereas in BitTorrent the network members share the bits of data that constitute a movie, song, or book, in Bitcoin the network members share the ledger of all Bitcoin transactions.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-5419" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5420">Similar statistics can be produced for resources with varying degrees of prevalence in the earth's crust. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5421">The rarity of a resource determines the relative cost of extracting it from the earth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5422">More prevalent metals like iron and copper are easy to find, and relatively cheap as a result. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5423">Rarer metals, such as silver and gold, are more expensive. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5424">The limit on how much we can produce of each of those metals, however, remains the opportunity cost of their production relative to one another, and not their absolute quantity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5425">There is no better evidence for this than the fact that the rarest metal in the crust of the earth, gold, has been mined for thousands of years and continues to be mined in increasing quantities as technology advances over time, as shown in </span><a href="#calibre_link-13" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5426">Chapter 3</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5427">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5428">If annual production of the rarest metal in the earth's crust goes up every year, then it makes no sense to talk of any natural element as being limited in its quantity in any practical sense. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5429">Scarcity is only relative in material resources, with the differences in cost of extraction being the determinant of the level of scarcity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5430">The only scarcity, as Julian Simon brilliantly demonstrated, is in the time humans have to produce these metals, and that is why the global wage continues to rise worldwide, making products and materials continuously get cheaper in terms of human labor.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-5454" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5455">Kremer illustrates this by showing that as the population of the earth has increased, the rate of population growth has increased rather than declined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5456">Had humans been a burden consuming resources, then the larger the population, the lower the quantity of resources available to each individual and the lower the rate of economic growth and thus population growth, as the Malthusian model predicts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5457">But because humans are themselves the resource, and productive</span><span type="pagebreak" title="196" id="calibre_link-310" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5458"> ideas are the driver of economic production, a larger number of humans results in more productive ideas and technologies, more production per capita, and a higher capacity for sustaining larger populations. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5459">Further, Kremer shows how isolated landmasses that were more heavily populated witnessed faster economic growth and progress than those that were sparsely populated.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5460" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5461">It is a misnomer to call raw materials resources, because humans are not passive consumers of manna from heaven. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5462">Raw materials are always the product of human labor and ingenuity and thus humans are the ultimate resource, because human time, effort, and ingenuity can always be used to produce more output.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-5551" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5552">Similarly, information is allowing trade and employment to subvert government restrictions and regulations, as best exemplified by companies like Uber and Airbnb, which have not asked for government permission to introduce their products successfully and subvert traditional forms of regulation and supervision. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5553">Modern individuals can transact with others they meet online via systems of identity and protection built on consent and mutual respect, without any need for resort to coercive government regulations.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5554" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5555">The emergence of cheap forms of telecommunication online has also subverted the importance of geographic location for work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5556">Producers of many goods can now choose to be domiciled anywhere they prefer while the products of their labor, which are becoming increasingly informational and nonmaterial, can be transferred globally instantaneously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5557">Government regulations and taxes are becoming less powerful as individuals can live or work where it suits them and deliver their work via telecommunication.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-5623" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5624">Traditionally, gold was the medium of settlement of payments and store of value worldwide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5625">The inability of any party to expand its supply in any significant quantities made it so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5626">Its value was earned on the free market, and not a liability of anyone else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5627">As the scope of communication and travel grew larger in the nineteenth century, requiring financial transactions over longer distances, gold moved out of people's hands and into the vaults of banks, and eventually, central banks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5628">Under a gold standard, people held paper receipts in gold or wrote checks for it that cleared without physical gold having to be physically moved, vastly improving the speed and efficiency of global trade.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5629" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5630">As governments confiscated gold and issued their own money, it was no longer possible for global settlements between individuals and banks to be done with gold, and instead they were conducted with national currencies fluctuating in value, creating significant problems for international trade, as discussed in </span><a href="#calibre_link-24" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5631">Chapter 6</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5632">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5633">The invention of Bitcoin has created, from the ground up, a new independent alternative mechanism for international settlement that does not rely on any intermediary and can operate entirely separate from the existing financial infrastructure.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5634" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5635">The ability of any individual to run</span><span type="pagebreak" title="206" id="calibre_link-255" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5636"> a Bitcoin node and send his own money without permission from anyone, and without having to expose his identity, is a noteworthy difference between gold and Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5637">Bitcoin does not have to be stored on a computer; the private key to a person's bitcoin hoard is a string of characters or a string of words the person remembers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5638">It is far easier to move around with a Bitcoin private key than with a hoard of gold, and far easier to send it across the world without having to risk it getting stolen or confiscated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5639">Whereas governments confiscated people's gold savings and forced them to trade with money supposedly backed by that gold, people are able to keep the bulk of their bitcoin savings in storage away from government's hands and only use smaller amounts to transact through intermediaries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5640">The very nature of the Bitcoin technology puts governments at a severe disadvantage compared to all other forms of money and thus makes confiscation much harder.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5641" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5642">Further, the ability of bitcoin holders to track all holdings of bitcoin on its blockchain makes it extremely impractical for any authority to play the role of a lender of last resort for banks dealing with Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5643">Even in the heyday of the international gold standard, money was redeemable in gold, but central banks rarely had enough to cover the entire supply of currency they introduced, and thus always had a margin for increasing the supply of paper to back up the currency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5644">This is much harder with Bitcoin, which brings cryptographic digital certainty to accounting and can help expose banks engaging in fractional reserve banking.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5645" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5646">The future use of Bitcoin for small payments will likely not be carried out over the distributed ledger, as explained in the discussion on scaling in </span><a href="#calibre_link-25" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5647">Chapter 10</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5648">, but through second layers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5649">Bitcoin can be seen as the new emerging reserve currency for online transactions, where the online equivalent of banks will issue Bitcoin‐backed tokens to users while keeping their hoard of Bitcoins in cold storage, with each individual being able to audit in real time the holdings of the intermediary, and with online verification and reputation systems able to verify that no inflation is taking place. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5650">This would allow an infinite number of transactions to be carried out online without having to pay the high transaction fees for on‐chain transactions.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5651" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5652">As Bitcoin continues to evolve in the direction of having a higher market value with higher transaction fees, it starts to look more and more like a reserve currency than a currency</span><span type="pagebreak" title="207" id="calibre_link-209" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5653"> for everyday trading and transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5654">Even at the time of writing, with Bitcoin at a relatively small level of public adoption, the majority of Bitcoin transactions are not recorded on‐chain, but occur in exchanges and various types of Bitcoin‐based online platforms such as gambling and casino websites. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5655">These businesses will credit or debit bitcoins to their customers on their own internal records and then only make transactions on the Bitcoin network when customers deposit or withdraw funds.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5656" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5657">By virtue of being digital cash, Bitcoin's comparative advantage may not lie in replacing cash payments, but rather in allowing for cash payments to be carried out over long distances. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5658">Payments in person, for small amounts, can be conducted in a wide variety of options: physical cash, barter, favors, credit cards, bank checks, and so on. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5659">Current state‐of‐the‐art technology in payment settlements has already introduced a wide array of options for settling small‐scale payments with very little cost. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5660">It is likely that Bitcoin's advantage lies not in competing with these payments for small amounts and over short distances; Bitcoin's advantage, rather, is that by bringing the finality of cash settlement to the digital world, it has created the fastest method for final settlement of large payments across long distances and national borders. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5661">It is when compared to these payments that Bitcoin's advantages appear most significant. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5662">There are only a few currencies that are accepted for payment worldwide, namely the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5663">dollar, the euro, gold, and the IMF's Special Drawing Rights. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5664">The vast majority of international payments are denominated in one of these currencies, with only a tiny percentage shared by a few other major currencies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5665">To send a few thousand dollars' worth of these currencies internationally usually costs dozens of dollars, takes several days, and is subject to invasive forensic examination by financial institutions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5666">The high cost of these transactions lies primarily in the volatility of trading currencies and the problems of settlement between institutions in different countries, which necessitates the employment of several layers of intermediation.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5667" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5668">In less than ten years of existence, Bitcoin has already achieved a significant degree of global liquidity, allowing for international payments in prices that are currently much lower than existing international transfers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5669">This is not to argue that Bitcoin will replace the international money transfer market, but merely to point out its potential for international liquidity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5670">As it stands, the volume of these</span><span type="pagebreak" title="208" id="calibre_link-223" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5671"> international flows is far larger than what Bitcoin's blockchain can handle, and if more such payments move to Bitcoin, fees will rise to limit the demand for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5672">Yet, that would also not spell doom for Bitcoin, because sending these individual payments is not the limit of Bitcoin's capabilities.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5673" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5674">Bitcoin is money free of counterparty risk, and its network can offer final settlement of large‐volume payments within minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5675">Bitcoin can thus be best understood to compete with settlement payments between central banks and large financial institutions, and it compares favorably to them due to its verifiable record, cryptographic security, and imperviousness to third‐party security holes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5676">Using the major national currencies (USD, euro) for settlement carries with it the risk of exchange rate fluctuation of these currencies and involves trust in several layers of existing intermediation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5677">Settlements between central banks and large financial institutions take days, and sometimes weeks, to clear, during which time each party is exposed to significant foreign exchange and counterparty risk. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5678">Gold is the only traditional monetary medium that is not someone's liability, and is free of counterparty risk, but moving gold around is an extremely expensive operational task, fraught with risks.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5679" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5680">Bitcoin, having no counterparty risk and no reliance on any third‐party, is uniquely suited to play the same role that gold played in the gold standard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5681">It is a neutral money for an international system that does not give any one country the “exorbitant privilege” of issuing the global reserve currency, and is not dependent on its economic performance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5682">Being separated from any particular country's economy, its value will not be affected by the volume of trade denominated in it, averting all the exchange rate problems that have plagued the twentieth century. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5683">Further, the finality of settlement on Bitcoin does not rely on any counterparty, and does not require any single bank to be the de facto arbiter, making it ideal for a network of global peers, rather than a global hegemonic centralized order. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5684">The Bitcoin network is based on a form of money whose supply cannot be inflated by any single member bank, making it a more attractive store‐of‐value proposition than national currencies whose creation was precisely so their supply could be increased to finance governments.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5685" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5686">Bitcoin's capacity for transactions is far more than what the current number of central banks would need even if they settled their accounts daily. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5687">Bitcoin's current capacity of around</span><span type="pagebreak" title="209" id="calibre_link-250" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5688"> 350,000 transactions per day can allow a global network of 850 banks to each have one daily transaction with every other bank on the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5689">(The number of unique connections in a network equals </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5690">n</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5691">(</span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5692">n</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5693"> &ndash; 1)/2, where </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5694">n</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5695"> is the number of nodes.)</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-5701" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5702">In a world in which no government can create more bitcoins, these Bitcoin central banks would compete freely with one another in offering physical and digital bitcoin‐backed monetary instruments and payment solutions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5703">Without a lender of last resort, fractional reserve banking becomes an extremely dangerous arrangement and it would be my expectation the only banks that will survive in the long run would be banks offering financial instruments 100% backed by Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5704">This, however, is a point of contention among economists and time can only tell whether that will be the case. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5705">These banks would settle payments between their own customers outside of Bitcoin's blockchain and then perform final daily settlement between each other over the blockchain.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-5732" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5733">If Bitcoin continues to grow in value and gets utilized by a growing number of financial institutions, it will become a reserve currency for a new form of central bank. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5734">These central banks could be primarily based in the digital or physical worlds, but it is becoming worth considering if national central banks should supplement their reserves with Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5735">In the current monetary global system, national central banks hold reserves mainly in U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5736">dollars, euros, British pounds, IMF Standard Drawing Rights, and gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5737">These reserve currencies are used to settle accounts between central banks and to defend the market value of their local currencies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5738">Should Bitcoin's appreciation continue in the same manner it has experienced over the past few years, it is</span><span type="pagebreak" title="211" id="calibre_link-628" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5739"> likely to attract the attention of central banks with an eye on the future.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5740" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5741">If Bitcoin continues to appreciate significantly, it will provide the central bank more flexibility with their monetary policy and international account settlement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5742">But perhaps the real case for central banks owning bitcoin is as insurance against the scenario of it succeeding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5743">Given that the supply of bitcoins is strictly limited, it may be wise for a central bank to spend a small amount acquiring a small portion of bitcoin's supply today in case it appreciates significantly in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5744">If bitcoin continues to appreciate while a central bank doesn't own any of it, then the market value of their reserve currencies and gold will be declining in terms of Bitcoin, placing the central bank at a disadvantage the later it decides to acquire reserves.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5745" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5746">Bitcoin is still viewed as a quirky Internet experiment for now, but as it continues to survive and appreciate over time, it will start attracting real attention from high‐net‐worth individuals, institutional investors, and then, possibly, central banks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5747">The point at which central banks start to consider using it is the point at which they are all engaged in a reverse bank run on Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5748">The first central bank to buy bitcoin will alert the rest of the central banks to the possibility and make many of them rush toward it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5749">The first central bank purchase is likely to make the value of Bitcoin rise significantly and thus make it progressively more expensive for later central banks to buy it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5750">The wisest course of action in this case is for a central bank to purchase a small share of Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5751">If the central bank has the institutional capacity to purchase the currency without announcing it, that would be an even wiser course of action, allowing the central bank to accumulate it at low prices.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5752" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5753">Bitcoin can also serve as a useful reserve asset for central banks facing international restrictions on their banking operations, or unhappy at the dollar‐centric global monetary system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5754">The possibility of adopting Bitcoin reserves might itself prove a valuable bargaining chip for these central banks with U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5755">monetary authorities, who would probably prefer not to see any central banks defect to Bitcoin as a method of settlement, because that would then entice others to join.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5756" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5757">While central banks have mostly been dismissive of the importance of Bitcoin, this could be a luxury they may not afford for long. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5758">As hard as it might be for central bankers to believe it, Bitcoin is a direct competitor to their line of business, which</span><span type="pagebreak" title="212" id="calibre_link-219" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5759"> has been closed off from market competition for a century. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5760">Bitcoin makes global processing of payments and final clearance available for anyone to perform at a small cost, and it replaces human‐directed monetary policy with superior and perfectly predictable algorithms. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5761">The modern central bank business model is being disrupted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5762">Central banks now have no way of stopping competition by just passing laws as they have always done. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5763">They are now up against a digital competitor that most likely cannot be brought under the physical world's laws. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5764">Should national central banks not use Bitcoin's instant clearance and sound monetary policy, they would leave the door open for digital upstarts to capture more and more of this market for a store of value and settlement.</span></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-555" class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5771">Global Unit of Account</span></h2>
<p id="calibre_link-5772" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5773">This final application of Bitcoin is not one that is likely to materialize any time soon, but is nonetheless intriguing given Bitcoin's unique properties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5774">Since the end of the gold standard era, global trade has been hampered by the differences in currency value across different countries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5775">This destroyed people's ability to conduct indirect exchange using a single medium of exchange and instead created a world where buying something across borders has to be preceded by buying the currency of the producer, almost mimicking barter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5776">This has severely hampered people's ability to conduct economic calculation across borders and resulted in the growth of a massive foreign exchange industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5777">That industry produces little of value but an amelioration</span><span type="pagebreak" title="213" id="calibre_link-319" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5778"> of the terrible consequences of monetary nationalism.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5779" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5780">The gold standard offered a solution to this problem, wherein a single form of money, independent of the control of any single government or authority, was the monetary standard worldwide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5781">Prices could be calibrated against gold and expressed in it, facilitating calculation across borders. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5782">The physical heft of gold, however, meant that it had to be centralized and settlement had to be carried out between central banks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5783">Once the gold was centralized, its lure proved irresistible for governments, who took control of it and eventually replaced it with fiat money whose supply they control. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5784">Sound money became unsound as a result.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5785" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5786">It is an open question whether Bitcoin could potentially play the role of a global unit of account for trade and economic activity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5787">For this possibility to materialize, Bitcoin would need to be adopted by an extremely large number of people in the world, most likely indirectly, through its use as a reserve currency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5788">It would then remain to be seen whether the stability of bitcoin's supply would make it also stable in value, as daily transactions in it would be marginal compared to the quantities held. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5789">As it stands, given that Bitcoin constitutes less than 1% of the global money supply, large individual transactions in Bitcoin can have a large impact on price, and small variations in demand can cause large swings in price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5790">This, however, is a feature of the current situation where Bitcoin as a global settlement network and currency is still a tiny fraction of global settlement payments and money supply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5791">Buying a Bitcoin token today can be considered an investment in the fast growth of the network and currency as a store of value, because it is still very small and able to grow many multiples of its size and value very quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5792">Should Bitcoin's share of the global money supply and international settlement transactions become a majority share of the global market, the level of demand for it will become far more predictable and stable, leading to a stabilization in the value of the currency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5793">Hypothetically, should bitcoin become the only money used around the world, it will no longer have large room for growth in value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5794">At that point, demand for it will simply be demand for holding liquid money, and the speculative investment aspect of the demand we see today would disappear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5795">In such a situation, the value of bitcoin would vary along with the time preference of the entire world's population, with increasing demand for</span><span type="pagebreak" title="214" id="calibre_link-268" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5796"> holding Bitcoin as a store of value leading to only small appreciation of its value.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5797" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5798">In the long run, the absence of any authority that can control bitcoin's supply will likely go from creating volatility in the price to reducing it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5799">The predictability of the supply combined with growth in the number of users could make daily fluctuations in demand less significant determinants of price, as market makers are able to hedge and smooth supply‐and‐demand fluctuations and create a more stable price.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5800" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5801">The situation would be similar to gold under the gold standard, as detailed in Jastram's study referenced in </span><a href="#calibre_link-24" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5802">Chapter 6</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5803">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5804">For centuries during which gold was used as money, the steady and gradual increase in its supply meant that its value did not increase or decrease significantly, making it the perfect unit of account across space and time.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5805" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5806">But this scenario ignores one fundamental difference between gold and Bitcoin, and that is that gold has large and highly elastic demand for use in a multitude of industrial and ornamental applications. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5807">Gold's unique chemical properties have ensured that it is always in high demand regardless of its monetary role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5808">Even as monetary demand for gold changes, industry stands ready to utilize essentially limitless quantities of gold should the price drop due to a decrease in monetary demand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5809">Gold's properties make it the best choice for many applications, for which inferior substitutes are only chosen due to gold's high price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5810">Even in a scenario where all global central banks dispose of all their gold reserves, jewelry and industrial demand is likely to absorb all that excess supply with only temporary reductions in price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5811">The rarity of gold in the earth's crust will always ensure it will remain expensive relative to other materials and metals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5812">This property has been instrumental in the rise of gold as money because it ensured a relative stability of value for gold over time, regardless of global changes in monetary demand through countries going on or off the gold standard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5813">This relative stability in turn solidified gold's appeal as a monetary asset and ensured demand for it, and can be understood as the real reason central banks do not sell their gold reserves decades after their currencies stopped being redeemable in it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5814">Should central banks sell their gold reserves, the net effect will be that tons more gold will be utilized in industrial applications over the coming few years, with a small impact on gold's price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5815">In this trade, the central bank would</span><span type="pagebreak" title="215" id="calibre_link-629" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5816"> only gain a fiat currency it can print itself, and would lose an asset which will likely gain value over its own currency.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5817" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5818">The equivalent nonmonetary demand for bitcoin can be understood as the demand for the coins not as a store of value, but as a necessary prerequisite to using the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5819">But unlike industrial demand for gold, which is completely independent of its monetary demand, demand for bitcoin to operate the network is inextricably linked to demand for it as a store of value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5820">It thus cannot be expected to play a significant role in ameliorating the volatility of bitcoin's market value as it is growing in its monetary role.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5821" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5822">On the one hand, Bitcoin's strict scarcity makes it a very attractive choice for a store of value, and an ever‐growing number of holders could tolerate the volatility for long periods of time if it is heavily skewed to the upside, as has been the case so far. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5823">On the other hand, the persistence of volatility in bitcoin's value will prevent it from playing the role of a unit of account, at least until it has grown to many multiples of its current value and in the percentage of people worldwide who hold and accept it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5824" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5825">Yet, considering that the world's population today has only lived in a world of volatile fiat currencies shifting against each other, bitcoin holders should be far more tolerant of its volatility than generations reared under the certainty of the gold standard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5826">Only the best fiat currencies have been stable in the short‐term, but the devaluation in the long term is evident. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5827">Gold, on the other hand, has maintained long‐term stability, but it is relatively unstable in the short term. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5828">Bitcoin's lack of stability does not seem like a fatal flaw that would prevent its growth and adoption given that all its alternatives are also relatively unstable.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5829" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5830">Such questions cannot be answered definitively at this point, and only the real world will tell how these dynamics will unfold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5831">Monetary status is a spontaneously emergent product of human action, not a rational product of human design.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-36" href="#calibre_link-27" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5832">9</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5833"> Individuals act out of self‐interest, and technological possibilities and the economic realities of supply and demand shape the outcomes of their actions, providing them incentives to persist, adapt, change, or innovate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5834">A</span><span type="pagebreak" title="216" id="calibre_link-356" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5835"> spontaneous monetary order emerges from these complex interactions; it is not something that is conferred through academic debate, rational planning, or government mandate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5836">What might appear like a better technology for money in theory may not necessarily succeed in practice. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5837">Bitcoin's volatility may make monetary theorists dismiss it as a monetary medium, but monetary theories cannot override the spontaneous order that emerges on the market as a result of human actions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5838">As a store of value, Bitcoin may continue to attract more savings demand, causing it to continue appreciating significantly compared to all other forms of money until it becomes the prime choice for anyone looking to get paid.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5839" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5840">Should it achieve some sort of stability in value, Bitcoin would be superior to using national currencies for global payment settlements, as is the case today, because national currencies fluctuate in value based on each nation's and government's conditions, and their widespread adoption as a global reserve currency results in an “exorbitant privilege” to the issuing nation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5841">An international settlement currency should be neutral to the monetary policy of different countries, which is why gold played this role with excellence during the international gold standard. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5842">Bitcoin would have an advantage over gold in playing this role because its settlement can be completed in minutes, and the authenticity of the transactions can be trivially verified by anyone with an Internet connection, at virtually no cost. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5843">Gold, on the other hand, takes more time to transport, and its clearance relies on varying degrees of trust in intermediaries responsible for settling it and transferring it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5844">This might preserve gold's monetary role for in‐person cash transactions while Bitcoin specializes in international settlement.</span></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-557" class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5910">Is Bitcoin Mining a Waste?</span></h2>
<p id="calibre_link-5911" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5912">Anyone who joins the Bitcoin network generates a </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5913">public address</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5914"> and a </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5915">private key</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5916">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5917">These are analogous to an email address and its password: people can send you bitcoins to your public address while you use your private key to send bitcoins from your balance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5918">These addresses can also be presented in Quick Response (QR) code format.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5919" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5920">When a transaction is made, the sender broadcasts it to all other network members (nodes), who can verify the sender has enough bitcoins to fulfill it, and that he has not spent these coins on another transaction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5921">Once the transaction is validated by a majority of the CPU behind the network, it is inscribed onto the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="218" id="calibre_link-191" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5922"> common ledger shared by all network members, allowing all members to update the balance of the two transacting members. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5923">While it is easy for any network member to verify the validity of a transaction, a system of voting based on giving each member one vote could be gamed by a hacker creating a lot of nodes to vote to validate their fraudulent transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5924">Only by making accuracy based on CPU cycles expended by members, in other words, employing a proof‐of‐work system, can Bitcoin solve the double‐spending problem without a trusted third party.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5925" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5926">In its essence, proof‐of‐work involves network members competing to solve mathematical problems that are hard to solve but whose solution is easy to verify. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5927">All Bitcoin transactions verified in a ten‐minute interval are transcribed and grouped together into one block. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5928">Nodes compete to solve the PoW math problems for a block of transactions, and the first node to produce the correct solution broadcasts it to network members, who can very quickly verify its correctness. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5929">Once the validity of the transactions and PoW are verified by a majority of the network nodes, a set quantity of bitcoin is issued to reward the node that correctly solved the PoW. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5930">This is known as the </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5931">block subsidy</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5932">, and the process of generating the new coins has been referred to as </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5933">mining</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5934">, because it is the only way that the supply of coins is increased, in the same way that mining is the only way to increase the supply of gold. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5935">On top of the block subsidy, the node that correctly solved the PoW also gets the </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5936">transaction fees</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5937"> included by senders. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5938">The sum of the transaction fees and the block subsidy is the </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5939">block reward</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5940">.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5941" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5942">Although solving these problems might initially seem a wasteful use of computing and electric power, proof‐of‐work is essential to the operation of Bitcoin.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-385" href="#calibre_link-369" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5943">1</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5944"> By requiring the expenditure of electricity and processing power to produce new bitcoins, PoW is the only method so far discovered for making the production </span><span type="pagebreak" title="219" id="calibre_link-323" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5945">of a digital good reliably expensive, allowing it to be a hard money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5946">By ensuring that finding the solution to the mathematical problem consumes large quantities of processing power and electricity, nodes who expend that processing power have a very strong incentive to not include any invalid transactions in their blocks to receive the block reward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5947">Because it is far cheaper to verify the validity of transactions and the PoW than it is to solve the PoW, nodes attempting to enter invalid transactions into a block are almost certainly doomed to failure, ensuring that their expended processing power goes unrewarded.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5948" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5949">PoW makes the cost of writing a block extremely high and the cost of verifying its validity extremely low, almost eliminating the incentive for anyone to try to create invalid transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5950">If they tried, they would be wasting electricity and processing power without receiving the block reward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5951">Bitcoin can thus be understood as a technology that converts electricity to truthful records through the expenditure of processing power. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5952">Those who expend this electricity are rewarded with the bitcoin currency, and so they have a strong incentive to maintain its integrity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5953">As a result of attaching a strong economic incentive for honesty, Bitcoin's ledger has been practically incorruptible for the period of its operation so far, with no example of a successful double‐spend attack on a confirmed transaction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5954">This integrity of the bitcoin ledger of transactions is achieved without having to rely on any single party being honest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5955">By relying entirely on verification, Bitcoin dooms fraudulent transactions to failure and obviates the need for trust in anyone for transactions to be completed.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5956" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5957">For an attacker to try to insert fraudulent transactions into the Bitcoin ledger, he would need to have a majority of the processing power behind the network to accept his fraud. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5958">Honest nodes that are part of the network would have no incentive to do so, because it would undermine the integrity of Bitcoin and devalue the rewards they are receiving, wasting the electricity and resources they have expended on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5959">So an attacker's only hope would be to mobilize a quantity of processing power that constitutes more than 50% of the network to verify his fraud and build on it as if it were valid. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5960">Such a move could have been possible in the early days of Bitcoin when the total processing power behind the network was very small. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5961">But because the economic value held in the network at the time was nonexistent or insignificant, no such attacks materialized. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5962">As the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="220" id="calibre_link-630" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5963"> network continued to grow and more members brought processing power to it, the cost to attack the network rose.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5964" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5965">The reward to nodes for verifying transactions has proven to be a profitable use of processing power. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5966">In January 2017, the processing power behind the Bitcoin network is equivalent to that of 2 trillion consumer laptops. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5967">It is more than two million times larger than the processing power of the world's largest supercomputer, and more than 200,000 times larger than the world's top 500 supercomputers combined. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5968">By monetizing processing power directly, Bitcoin has become the largest single‐purpose computer network in the world.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5969" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5970">Another contributing factor in this growth in processing power is that the verification of transactions and the solving of the PoW problems has moved from being conducted by personal computers to specialized processers built specifically to be optimally efficient at running the Bitcoin software. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5971">These Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) were first introduced in 2012, and their deployment has made adding processing power to the Bitcoin network more efficient, because no electricity is wasted on any irrelevant computing processes that would be present in any other, non‐Bitcoin‐specific computing unit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5972">A global distributed network of independent dedicated miners now protects the integrity of the Bitcoin ledger. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5973">All of these miners have no conceivable purpose but verifying Bitcoin transactions and solving proof‐of‐work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5974">Should Bitcoin fail for whatever reason, these ASICs would be rendered useless and their owners' investment would be lost, so they have a strong incentive to maintain the honesty of the network.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5975" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5976">For someone to alter the record of the network they would need to invest hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars building new ASIC chips to alter it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5977">Should an attacker succeed in altering the record, he would be highly unlikely to gain any economic benefit from it, as compromising the network would probably reduce the value of bitcoins to close to nothing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5978">In other words, to destroy Bitcoin, an attacker needs to expend very large sums of money with no return at all. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5979">And in fact, even if such an attempt succeeded, the honest nodes on the network can effectively go back to the record of transactions before the attack and resume operation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5980">The attacker would then need to continue incurring significant running costs to keep attacking the consensus of the honest nodes.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5981" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5982">In its early years, Bitcoin users would</span><span type="pagebreak" title="221" id="calibre_link-631" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5983"> run nodes and use them to carry out their own transactions and to verify each other's transactions, making each node a wallet and a verifier/miner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5984">But with time, these functions have been separated. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5985">ASIC chips are now specialized only in verifying transactions to receive reward coins (which is why they are commonly referred to as miners). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5986">Node operators can now generate unlimited wallets, allowing businesses to offer convenient wallets for users who can send and receive bitcoins without operating a node or spending processing power on verifying transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5987">This has moved Bitcoin away from being a pure peer‐to‐peer network between identical nodes, but the main functional importance of the decentralized and distributed nature of the network has arguably remained intact, as a large number of nodes still exists and no single party is relied on to operate the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5988">Further, specialized mining has allowed for the processing power backing the network to grow to the astoundingly large size it has reached.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5989" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5990">In its early days, when the tokens had little or no value, the network could have been conceivably hijacked and destroyed by attackers, but as the network had little economic value, nobody seems to have bothered. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5991">As the economic value held on the network increased, the incentive to attack the network may have increased, but the cost of doing so rose much more, resulting in no attacks materializing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5992">But perhaps the real protection of the Bitcoin network at any point in time is that the value of its tokens is entirely dependent on the integrity of the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5993">Any attack that succeeds in altering the blockchain, stealing coins, or double‐spending them would be of little value to the attacker, as it would become apparent to all network members that it is possible to compromise the network, severely reducing demand for using the network and holding the coins, crashing the price. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5994">In other words, the defense of the Bitcoin network is not just that attacking it has become expensive, but that the attack succeeding renders the attacker's loot worthless. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5995">Being an entirely voluntary system, Bitcoin can only operate if it is honest, as users can very easily leave it otherwise.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-5996" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5997">The distribution of the Bitcoin processing power, and the strong resistance of the code to change, combined with the intransigency of the monetary policy, are what has allowed Bitcoin to survive and grow in value to the extent to which it has today. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5998">It is hard for people new to Bitcoin to appreciate just how many logistical</span><span type="pagebreak" title="222" id="calibre_link-632" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-5999"> and security challenges Bitcoin has had to endure over the years to arrive at where it is today. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6000">Bearing in mind that the Internet has created opportunities for hackers to attack all sorts of networks and websites for fun and profit, this achievement becomes more startling. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6001">The ever‐growing number of security breaches that happen to computer networks and email servers across the world on a daily basis have occurred to systems which offer the attackers not much more than data or opportunities to score political points. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6002">Bitcoin, on the other hand, contains billions of dollars of value, but continues to operate safely and reliably because it was built, from day one, to operate in a highly adversarial setting, subject to relentless attack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6003">Programmers and hackers worldwide have tried to tear it apart using all sorts of techniques, and yet it has continued to operate according to the exact essence of its specification.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-6009" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6010">Bitcoin's resilience has so far not been restricted to successfully repelling attacks; it has also ably resisted any attempt at changing it or altering its characteristics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6011">The true depth of this statement and its implications has not yet been fully realized by most skeptics. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6012">If Bitcoin's currency were to be compared to a central bank, it would be the world's most independent central bank. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6013">If it were to be compared to a nation‐state, it would be the most sovereign nation‐state in the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6014">The sovereignty of Bitcoin is derived from the fact that, as far as anyone can tell, the way its consensus rules operate makes it very resistant to alteration by individuals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6015">It is no exaggeration to say nobody controls Bitcoin, and that the only option available to people is to use it as it is or not use it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6016" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6017">This immutability is not a feature of the Bitcoin software, which is trivial to change for anyone with coding skills, but rather is grounded in the economics of the currency and network, and stems from the difficulty of getting every member of the network to adopt the same changes to the software. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6018">The software implementation that</span><span type="pagebreak" title="223" id="calibre_link-251" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6019"> allows an individual to run a node that connects to the Bitcoin network is open source software, which was initially made available by Satoshi Nakamoto in collaboration with the late Hal Finney and some other programmers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6020">Since then, any person has been free to download and use the software as he or she pleases, and to make changes to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6021">This creates a freely competitive market in Bitcoin implementations, with anyone free to contribute changes or improvements to the software and present them to users for adoption.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6022" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6023">Over time, hundreds of computer programmers from around the world have volunteered their time to improve the node software and in the process improve the capabilities of individual nodes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6024">These coders have formed several different implementations, the largest and most popular of which is known as “Bitcoin Core.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6025">Several other implementations exist, and users are free to alter the source code at any point. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6026">The only requirement for a node to be a part of the network is that it follows the consensus rules of the other nodes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6027">Nodes which break the consensus rules by altering the structure of the chain, the validity of the transaction, the block reward, or any one of many other parameters in the system end up having their transactions rejected by the rest of the nodes.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-6038" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6039">Bitcoin's coders, then, for all their competence, cannot control Bitcoin, and are only Bitcoin coders to the extent that they provide node operators with software the node operators want to adopt. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6040">But coders aren't the only ones who cannot control Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6041">Miners, too, for all of the hashing power they can marshal, also cannot control Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6042">No matter how much hashing power is expended on processing blocks that are invalid, they will not be validated by a majority of Bitcoin nodes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6043">Therefore, if miners attempted to change the rules of the network, the blocks they generate would simply be ignored by the network members who operate the nodes, and they would be wasting their resources on solving proof‐of‐work problems without any reward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6044">Miners are only Bitcoin miners to the extent that they produce blocks with valid transactions according to the current consensus rules.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6045" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6046">It would be tempting here to say that node operators control Bitcoin, and that is true in an abstract collective manner. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6047">More realistically, node operators can only control their own nodes and decide for themselves which network rules to join and which transactions they deem valid or invalid. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6048">Nodes are severely restricted in their choice of consensus rules because if they enforced rules inconsistent with the consensus of the network, their transactions would be rejected. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6049">Each node has a strong incentive to maintain network consensus rules and to stay compatible with nodes on these consensus rules. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6050">Each individual node is powerless to force other nodes to change their code, and that creates a strong collective bias to remain on the current consensus rules.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6051" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6052">In conclusion, the Bitcoin coders face a strong incentive to abide by consensus rules if they are to have their code adopted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6053">The miners have to abide by the network consensus rules to receive compensation for the resources they spend on proof‐of‐work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6054">The network members face a strong incentive to remain on the consensus rules to ensure they can clear their transactions on the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6055">Any individual coder, miner, or node operator is dispensable to the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6056">If they stray away from consensus rules, the most likely outcome is that they will individually waste resources. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6057">As long as the network provides</span><span type="pagebreak" title="225" id="calibre_link-634" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6058"> positive rewards to its participants, it's likely that replacement participants will come up. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6059">The consensus parameters of Bitcoin can thus be understood as being sovereign. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6060">To the extent that Bitcoin will exist, it will exist according to these parameters and specifications. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6061">This very strong status‐quo bias in Bitcoin's operation makes alterations to its money supply schedule, or important economic parameters, extremely difficult. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6062">It is only because of this stable equilibrium that Bitcoin can be considered hard money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6063">Should Bitcoin deviate from these consensus rules its value proposition as hard money would be seriously compromised.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6064" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6065">To the best of this author's knowledge, there have been no significant coordinated attempts to alter the monetary policy of Bitcoin,</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-387" href="#calibre_link-371" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6066">3</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6067"> but even far simpler attempts at altering some of the technical specifications of the code have so far failed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6068">The reason that even seemingly innocuous changes to the protocol are extremely hard to carry out is the distributed nature of the network, and the need for many disparate and adversarial parties to agree to changes whose impact they cannot fully understand, while the safety and tried‐and‐tested familiarity of the status quo remains fully familiar and dependable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6069">Bitcoin's status quo can be understood as a stable Schelling point,</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-388" href="#calibre_link-372" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6070">4</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6071"> which provides a useful incentive for all participants to stick to it, while the move away from it will always involve a significant risk of loss.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6072" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6073">If some members of the Bitcoin network decided to change a parameter in the Bitcoin code by introducing a new version of the software that is incompatible with the rest of the network members, the result would be a fork, which effectively creates two separate currencies and networks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6074">For as long as any members stay on the old network, they would benefit from the infrastructure of the network as it exists, the mining equipment, the network effect, and name recognition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6075">In order for the new fork to succeed it would need an overwhelming majority of users, mining hashing power, and all of the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="226" id="calibre_link-635" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6076"> related infrastructure to migrate at the same time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6077">If it doesn't get that overwhelming majority, the likeliest outcome is that the two Bitcoins would trade versus one another on exchanges. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6078">Should the people behind the fork hope for their fork to succeed, they will have to sell their coins on the old fork and hope everyone else does the same, so that the price of it collapses and the price of the new fork rises, thus driving all the mining power and economic network to the new network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6079">But because any change in any parameter in Bitcoin's operation is likely to have beneficial effects on some network members at the expense of others, it is unlikely that a consensus would form to shift to the new coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6080">More broadly, the majority of Bitcoin holders only hold it because they were attracted to the automated nature of its rules and their imperviousness to direction by third parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6081">Such individuals are highly unlikely to want to risk giving discretion for fundamental changes to the network to a new group proposing a new incompatible codebase. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6082">Whether such a majority exists or not is a moot point; what matters is that enough of them exist to make it always certain that they will continue with the current system parameters, unless their operation is compromised for some reason.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6083" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6084">Barring such catastrophic failure in the current design, it is a safe bet that there will be a significant percentage of nodes choosing to stay with the old implementation, which automatically makes that choice far safer for anyone considering going onto a fork. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6085">The problem with deciding to go onto a fork is that the only way to help it succeed is by selling your coins on the old chain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6086">Nobody wants to sell their coins on the old network to move to the new network, only to find that not everybody moved and the value of the coins on the new network collapses. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6087">In summation, no move to a new implementation with consensus rules can take place unless the vast majority is willing to shift together, and any shift without the majority shifting is almost certain to be economically disastrous for everyone involved. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6088">Because any such move to a new implementation likely gives the party proposing the change significant control over the future direction of Bitcoin, bitcoin holders, who are needed for this shift to succeed, are to a large extent ideologically opposed to any such group having authority over Bitcoin and are highly unlikely to support such a move. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6089">The existence of this group makes supporting a fork highly risky for everybody else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6090">This analysis may help explain why Bitcoin has resisted all attempts to change</span><span type="pagebreak" title="227" id="calibre_link-636" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6091"> it significantly so far. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6092">The coordination problem of organizing a simultaneous shift among people with adversarial interests, many of whom are strongly vested in the notion of immutability for its own sake, is likely intractable barring any pressing reason for people to move away from current implementations.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6093" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6094">For instance, an edit to increase the issuance rate of the currency to raise the coins that reward miners might appeal to miners, but it would not appeal to current holders, and so they are unlikely to go with such a proposal. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6095">Similarly, an edit to increase the size of the Bitcoin network blocks would likely benefit miners by allowing them to run more transactions per block and possibly collect more transaction fees to maximize return on their investment in their mining equipment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6096">But it would likely not appeal to long‐term holders of Bitcoin, who would worry that larger blocks would cause the size of the blockchain to grow much bigger, and thus make running a full node more expensive, thereby dropping the number of nodes in the network, making the network more centralized and thus more vulnerable to attack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6097">The coders who develop software to run Bitcoin nodes are powerless to impose changes on anybody; all they can do is propose code, and users are free to download whichever code and version they like. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6098">Any code that is compatible with the existing implementations will be far more likely to be downloaded than any code that is not compatible, because the latter would only succeed if the overwhelming majority of the network also ran it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6099" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6100">As a result, Bitcoin exhibits extremely strong status‐quo bias. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6101">Only minor and uncontroversial changes to the code have been implemented so far, and every attempt to alter the network significantly has ended with resounding failure, to the delight of long‐term Bitcoin stalwarts who like nothing more about their currency than its immutability and resistance to change. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6102">The highest‐profile of these attempts have concerned increasing the size of individual blocks to increase transaction throughput. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6103">Several projects have gathered the names of some very prominent and old‐time Bitcoiners, and spent a lot on trying to gain publicity for the coin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6104">Gavin Andresen, who was one of the faces most publicly associated with Bitcoin, has pushed very aggressively for several attempts to fork Bitcoin into having bigger blocks, along with many stakeholders, including some skilled developers and deep‐pocketed entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6105" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6106">Initially, Bitcoin XT was proposed by</span><span type="pagebreak" title="228" id="calibre_link-637" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6107"> Andresen and a developer by the name of Mike Hearn in June 2015, aiming at increasing the size of a block from 1MB to 8MB. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6108">But the majority of nodes refused to update to their software and preferred to stay on the 1‐megabyte blocks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6109">Hearn was then hired by a “blockchain consortium of financial institutions” to bring blockchain technology to the financial markets, and published a blogpost to coincide with a glowing profile of him in the </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6110">New York Times</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6111"> which hailed him as desperately trying to save Bitcoin while painting Bitcoin as now being doomed to failure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6112">Hearn proclaimed “the resolution of the Bitcoin experiment”, citing the lack of growth in transaction capacity as a lethal roadblock to Bitcoin's success and announcing he had sold all his coins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6113">The bitcoin price on that day was around $350. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6114">Over the following two years, the price was to increase more than forty‐fold while the “blockchain consortium” he joined is yet to produce any actual products.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6115" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6116">Undeterred, Gavin Andresen immediately proposed a new attempt to fork Bitcoin under the name of “Bitcoin Classic,” which would have raised the blocksize to 8 megabytes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6117">This attempt fared no better, and by March 2016 the number of nodes supporting it began to fizzle. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6118">Yet, supporters of increasing the blocksize regrouped into Bitcoin Unlimited in 2017, an even wider coalition that included the largest maker of Bitcoin mining chips, as well as a wealthy individual who controls the </span><a href="http://bitcoin.com" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6119">bitcoin.com</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6120"> domain name and has spent enormous resources trying to promote larger blocks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6121">A lot of media hype was generated and the sense of crisis was palpable to many who follow Bitcoin news on mainstream media and social media; yet the reality remained that no fork was attempted, as the majority of nodes continued to run on the 1MB‐compatible implementations.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6122" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6123">Finally, in August 2017, a group of programmers proposed a new fork of Bitcoin under the name of “Bitcoin Cash,” which included many of the earlier advocates of increasing the block size. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6124">The fate of Bitcoin Cash is a vivid illustration of the problems with a Bitcoin fork that does not have consensus support. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6125">Because a majority chose to stay with the original chain, and the economic infrastructure of exchanges and businesses supporting Bitcoin is still largely focused on the original Bitcoin, this has kept the value of Bitcoin's coins much higher than that of Bitcoin Cash, and the price of Bitcoin Cash continued to drop until it hit a low of 5% of Bitcoin's value in</span><span type="pagebreak" title="229" id="calibre_link-638" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6126"> November 2017. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6127">Not only is the fork unable to gain economic value, it is also dogged with a serious technical problem that renders it almost unusable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6128">Seeing as the new chain has the same hashing algorithm as Bitcoin, miners can utilize their processing power on both chains and receive rewards in both. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6129">But because Bitcoin's coins are far more valuable than Bitcoin Cash, the processing power behind Bitcoin remains far higher than that of Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin miners can shift to Bitcoin Cash any time the rewards get high. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6130">This leaves Bitcoin Cash in an unfortunate dilemma: if the mining difficulty is too high, then there will be a long delay for blocks to be produced and transactions to process. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6131">But if the difficulty is set too low, the coin is mined very quickly and the supply increases quickly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6132">This increases the supply of the Bitcoin Cash coins faster than the Bitcoin chain, and would lead to the coin reward for Bitcoin Cash running out very quickly, thus reducing the incentive for future miners to mine it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6133">Most likely, this will have to lead to a hard fork that adjusts the supply growth to continue offering rewards to miners. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6134">This problem is unique to a chain breaking off from Bitcoin, but was never true for Bitcoin itself. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6135">Bitcoin mining was always utilizing the largest amount of processing power for its algorithm, and the increase in processing power was always incremental as miners employed more mining capacity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6136">But with a coin that breaks off from Bitcoin, the lower value of the coin and the lower difficulty makes the coin constantly vulnerable for quick mining by the much larger mining capacity of the more valuable chain.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6137" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6138">After the failure of this fork to challenge Bitcoin's prime position, another attempt at a fork to double the blocksize, negotiated between various startups active in the Bitcoin economy, was canceled in mid‐November as its promoters realized they were highly unlikely to achieve consensus for their move and would instead most likely end up with another coin and network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6139">Bitcoin stalwarts have learned to shrug at such attempts, realizing that no matter how much hype is generated, any attempt to change the consensus rules of Bitcoin will lead to the generation of yet another Bitcoin copycat, like the altcoins which copy Bitcoin's incidental details but do not have its only important characteristic: immutability. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6140">From the discussion above it should be clear that Bitcoin's advantages lie not in its speed, convenience, or friendly user experience. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6141">Bitcoin's value comes from it having an immutable monetary policy</span><span type="pagebreak" title="230" id="calibre_link-173" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6142"> precisely because nobody can easily change it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6143">Any coin that begins with a group of individuals changing Bitcoin's specification has with its creation lost arguably the only property that makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6144" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6145">Bitcoin is straightforward to use, but virtually impossible to alter. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6146">Bitcoin is voluntary, so nobody has to use it, but those who want to use it have no choice but to play by its rules. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6147">Changing Bitcoin in any meaningful way is not really possible, and should it be attempted, will produce another pointless knock‐off to be added to the thousands already out there. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6148">Bitcoin is to be taken as it is, accepted on its own terms and used for what it offers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6149">For all practical intents and purposes, Bitcoin is </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6150">sovereign</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6151">: it runs by its own rules, and there are no outsiders who can alter these rules. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6152">It might even be helpful to think of the parameters of Bitcoin as being similar to the rotation of the earth, sun, moon, or stars, forces outside of our control which are to be lived, not altered.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-6162" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6163">A global team of volunteer software developers, reviewers, and hackers have taken a professional, financial, and intellectual interest in working on improving or strengthening the Bitcoin code and network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6164">Any exploits or weaknesses found in the specification of the code will attract some of these coders to offer solutions, debate them, test them, and then propose them to network members for adoption. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6165">The only changes that have happened so far have been operational changes that allow the network to run more efficiently, but not changes that alter the essence of the coin's operation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6166">These coders can own Bitcoin tokens, and so have a financial incentive to work on ensuring Bitcoin grows and succeeds. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6167">In turn, the continued success</span><span type="pagebreak" title="231" id="calibre_link-639" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6168"> of Bitcoin rewards these coders financially and thus allows them to dedicate more time and effort to the maintenance of Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6169">Some of the prominent developers working on maintaining Bitcoin have become wealthy enough from investing in Bitcoin that they can make it their prime occupation without receiving pay from anyone.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6170" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6171">In terms of media coverage, Bitcoin appears to be a good embodiment of the adage “all publicity is good publicity.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6172">As a new technology that is not easy to understand, Bitcoin was always going to receive inaccurate and downright hostile media coverage, as was the case with many other technologies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6173">The website </span><a href="http://99bitcoins.com" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6174">99bitcoins.com</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6175"> has collected more than 200 examples of prominent articles announcing the death of Bitcoin over the years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6176">Some of these writers found Bitcoin to be a contravention to their worldview&mdash;usually related to the state theory of money or Keynesian faith in the importance of an elastic supply of money&mdash;and refused to consider the possibility they might be wrong. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6177">Instead, they concluded that it must be Bitcoin whose existence is wrong, and therefore they predicted it would die soon. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6178">Others believed strongly in the need for Bitcoin to change to maintain its success, and when they failed to get it to change in the way they desired, they concluded it must die. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6179">These people's attacks on Bitcoin led them to write about it and bring it to the attention of ever‐wider audiences. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6180">The more obituaries intensified, the more its processing power, transactions, and market value grew. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6181">Many Bitcoiners, this author included, only came around to appreciating the importance of Bitcoin by noticing how many times it had been written off, and how it continued to operate successfully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6182">The Bitcoin obituaries were powerless to stop it, but they seem to have helped it gain more publicity and awaken the public's curiosity to the fact that it continues to operate in spite of all the hostility and bad press it gets.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6183" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6184">A good example of Bitcoin's antifragility came in the fall of 2013, when the FBI arrested the alleged owner of the Silk Road website, which was a truly free online market allowing users to sell and buy anything they wanted online, including illegal drugs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6185">With Bitcoin's association in the public's mind with drugs and crime, most analysts predicted the closing of the website would destroy Bitcoin's utility. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6186">The price on that day dropped from around the $120 range to the $100 range, but it rebounded quickly and began a very fast rise, reaching $1,200 per bitcoin within a few months. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6187">At the time of writing, the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="232" id="calibre_link-174" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6188"> price had never again dropped to the level it was at before the closing of the Silk Road website. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6189">By surviving the closing of the Silk Road unscathed, Bitcoin demonstrated that it is far more than a currency for crime, and in the process it benefited from the free publicity from the Silk Road media coverage.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6190" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6191">Another example of Bitcoin's antifragility came in September 2017, after the Chinese government announced the closure of all Chinese exchanges that traded Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6192">Whereas the initial reaction was one of panic that saw the price drop by around 40%, it was only a matter of hours before the price started recovering, and within a few months the price had more than doubled from where it was before the government's ban. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6193">While banning exchanges from trading Bitcoin could be viewed as an impediment to Bitcoin's adoption through a reduction in its liquidity, it seems to have only served to reinforce Bitcoin's value proposition. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6194">More transactions started happening off exchanges in China, with volume on websites like </span><a href="http://localbitcoins.com" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6195">localbitcoins.com</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6196"> exploding. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6197">It may just be that the suspension of trading in China caused the opposite of the intended effect, as it drove Chinese to hold onto their Bitcoin for the long term rather than trade it for the short term.</span></p></section>

<h2 id="calibre_link-560" class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6199">Can Bitcoin Scale?</span></h2>
<p id="calibre_link-6200" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6201">At the time of writing, one of the most high‐profile debates surrounding Bitcoin concerns the question of scaling, or increasing the transaction capacity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6202">Bitcoin's 1‐megabyte blocks mean that the capacity for transactions as it stands is around less than 500,000 transactions per day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6203">Bitcoin has already approached these levels of transactions, and as a result, transaction fees have risen significantly over the past few months. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6204">The implementation of a technology called Segwit could result in a quadrupling of this daily capacity, but it is nonetheless becoming clear that there will be a hard limit to how many transactions can be processed over the Bitcoin blockchain, due to the decentralized and distributed nature of Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6205">Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded with all network nodes, who are all required to keep a copy of the entire ledger of all transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6206">This necessarily means that the cost of recording transactions will be far higher than for any centralized solution which only needs one record and a few backups. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6207">The most</span><span type="pagebreak" title="233" id="calibre_link-640" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6208"> efficient payment processing systems are all centralized for a good reason: it is cheaper to keep a central record than to keep several distributed records and have to worry about them updating in sync, a process which so far can only be achieved using Bitcoin proof‐of‐work.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6209" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6210">Centralized payment solutions, such as Visa or MasterCard, employ one centralized ledger to which all transactions are committed, as well as a backup that is entirely separate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6211">Visa can process around 3,200 transactions per second, or 100.8 billion transactions per year.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-389" href="#calibre_link-373" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6212">5</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6213"> Bitcoin's current 1‐megabyte blocks are able to process a maximum of four transactions per second, 350,000 transactions per day, or around 120 million transactions per year. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6214">For Bitcoin to process the 100 billion transactions that Visa processes, each block would need to be around 800 megabytes, meaning every ten minutes, each Bitcoin node would need to add 800 megabytes of data. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6215">In a year, each Bitcoin node would add around 42 terabytes of data, or 42,000 gigabytes, to its blockchain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6216">Such a number is completely outside the realm of possible processing power of commercially available computers now or in the foreseeable future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6217">The average consumer computer, or the average external hard drive, has a capacity in the order of 1 terabyte, about a week's worth of transactions at Visa volumes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6218">For some perspective, it is worth examining the sort of computing infrastructure that Visa employs to process these transactions.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6219" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6220">In 2013, a report showed that Visa owns a data center described as a “digital Fort Knox” containing 376 servers, 277 switches, 85 routers, and 42 firewalls.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-390" href="#calibre_link-374" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6221">6</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6222"> Granted, Visa's centralized system is a single point of failure, and so it employs very large amounts of redundancy and spare capacity to protect from unforeseen circumstances, whereas in the case of Bitcoin, the presence of many nodes would make each one of them non‐critical, and so requiring less security and capacity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6223">Nonetheless, a node that can add 42 terabytes of data every year would require a very expensive computer, and the network bandwidth required to process all of these transactions every day would be an enormous cost that would be clearly unworkably complicated and</span><span type="pagebreak" title="234" id="calibre_link-641" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6224"> expensive for a distributed network to maintain.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6225" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6226">There are only a handful of such centers in existence worldwide: those employed by Visa, MasterCard, and a few other payment processors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6227">Should Bitcoin attempt to process such a capacity, it could not possibly compete with these centralized solutions by having thousands of distributed centers on a similar scale; it would have to become centralized and employ only a few such data centers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6228">For Bitcoin to remain distributed, each node on the network must cost something reasonable for thousands of individuals to run it on commercially available personal computers, and the transfer of data between the nodes has to be at scales that are supported by regular consumer bandwidth.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6229" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6230">It is inconceivable that Bitcoin could run the same scale of transactions on‐chain that a centralized system can support. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6231">This explains why transaction costs are rising, and in most likelihood, will continue to rise if the network continues to grow. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6232">The biggest scope for scaling Bitcoin transactions will likely come off‐chain, where many simpler technologies can be used for small and unimportant payments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6233">This ensures there can be no compromise of Bitcoin's two most significant properties for which using extensive processing power is justified: digital sound money and digital cash. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6234">There are no alternative technologies that can offer these two functions, but there are many technologies that can offer small payments and consumer spending at low costs, and the technology for these choices is very simple to implement relatively reliably with current banking technologies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6235">Bitcoin mass use for merchant payments is not even very feasible given that it takes anywhere from 1 to 12 minutes for a transaction to receive its first confirmation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6236">Merchants and customers cannot wait that long on payments, and even though the risk of a double‐spend attack is not significant enough for one small payment, it is significant enough for merchants who receive large numbers of transactions as in the example of the attack on Betcoin Dice, discussed later in the section on attacks on Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6237" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6238">For people who want to use bitcoin as a digital long‐term store of value, or for people who want to carry out important transactions without having to go through a repressive government, the high transaction fees are a price well worth paying. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6239">Saving in Bitcoin by its very nature will not require many transactions, and so a high transaction fee is worth paying for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6240">And for</span><span type="pagebreak" title="235" id="calibre_link-642" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6241"> transactions that cannot be carried out through the regular banking system, such as people trying to get their money out of a country suffering inflation and capital controls, Bitcoin's high transaction fees will be a price well worth paying. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6242">Even at current low levels of adoption, the demand for digital cash and digital sound money has already raised transaction fees to the point where they cannot compete with centralized solutions like PayPal and credit cards for small payments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6243">This has not stalled Bitcoin's growth, however, which indicates that the market demand for Bitcoin is driven by its use as a digital cash and digital store of value, rather than small digital payments.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6244" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6245">If Bitcoin's popularity continues to grow, there are some potential scaling solutions that do not involve creating any changes to the structure of Bitcoin, but which take advantage of the way transactions are structured to increase the number of payments possible. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6246">Each Bitcoin transaction can contain several inputs and outputs, and using a technique called CoinJoin, several payments can be grouped together into one transaction, allowing several inputs and outputs for only a fraction of the space that would have been needed otherwise. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6247">This could potentially raise the transaction volume of Bitcoin to the millions of payments per day, and as the transaction costs rise higher, this is more and more likely to become a popular option.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6248" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6249">Another possibility for scaling Bitcoin is digital mobile USB wallets, which can be made to be physically tamper‐proof and can be checked for their balance at any time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6250">These USB drives would carry the private keys to specific amounts of Bitcoins, allowing whoever holds them to withdraw the money from them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6251">They could be used like physical cash, and each holder could verify the value in these drives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6252">As fees have been rising on the network, there has been no respite in the growth of demand for Bitcoin, as evidenced by its rising price, indicating that users value the transactions more than the transaction costs they have to pay for them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6253">Instead of the rising fees slowing Bitcoin's adoption, all that is happening is that the less important transactions are being moved off‐chain and the on‐chain transactions are growing in importance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6254">The most important use cases of Bitcoin, as a store of value and uncensorable payments, are well worth the transaction fees. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6255">When people buy Bitcoin to hold it for the long‐term, a one‐off small transaction fee is to be expected and is usually dwarfed by the commission</span><span type="pagebreak" title="236" id="calibre_link-643" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6256"> and the premium placed by the sellers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6257">For people looking to escape capital controls or send money to countries facing economic difficulties, the transaction fee is well worth paying considering Bitcoin is the only alternative. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6258">As Bitcoin adoption spreads, and transaction fees rise high enough that they will matter to the people paying them, there will be economic pressure to utilize more of the above scaling solutions which can increase transaction capacity without making changes that compromise the rules of the network and force a chain split.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6259" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6260">Beyond these possibilities, the majority of Bitcoin transactions today are already carried out off‐chain, and only settled on‐chain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6261">Bitcoin‐based businesses, such as exchanges, casinos, or gaming websites, will only use Bitcoin's blockchain for customer deposits and withdrawals, but within their platforms, all transactions are recorded on their local databases, denominated in Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6262">It is not possible to make accurate estimates of the number of these transactions due to the very large number of businesses, the lack of public data on the transactions taking place in their proprietary platforms, and the quickly shifting dynamics of the Bitcoin economy, but a conservative estimate would put them as being more than 10 times the number of transactions carried out on the Bitcoin blockchain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6263">In effect, Bitcoin is already being used as a reserve asset in the majority of the transactions in the Bitcoin economy. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6264">Should Bitcoin's growth continue it is only natural to see the number of off‐chain transactions increase faster than the on‐chain transactions.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6265" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6266">Such an analysis may contradict the rhetoric that accompanied the rise of Bitcoin, which promotes Bitcoin as putting an end to banks and banking. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6267">The idea that millions, let alone billions, could use the Bitcoin network directly for carrying out their every transaction is unrealistic as it would entail that every network member needs to be recording every other member's transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6268">As the numbers grow, these records become larger and constitute a significant computing burden. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6269">On the other hand, Bitcoin's unique properties as a store of value are likely to continue to increase demand for it, making it hard for it to survive as a purely peer‐to‐peer network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6270">For Bitcoin to continue to grow there will have to be payment processing solutions handled off the Bitcoin blockchain, and such solutions are emerging out of the grind of competitive markets.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6271" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6272">Another important reason why</span><span type="pagebreak" title="237" id="calibre_link-644" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6273"> banking as an institution is not going away is the convenience of banking custody. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6274">While many Bitcoin purists value the freedom accorded to them by being able to hold their own money and not rely on a financial institution to access it, the vast majority of people would not want this freedom and prefer to not have their money under their responsibility for fear of theft or abduction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6275">In the midst of the very common anti‐bank rhetoric that is popular these days, particularly in Bitcoin circles, it is easy to forget that deposit banking is a legitimate business which people have demanded for hundreds of years around the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6276">People have happily paid to have their money stored safely so they only need to carry a small amount of money on them and face little risk of loss. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6277">In turn, the widespread use of banking cards instead of cash allows people to carry small sums of money on them at all times, which likely makes modern society safer than it would be otherwise, because most potential assailants these days realize they are not likely to come across a victim carrying significant amounts of cash, and theft of banking cards is unlikely to yield significant sums before the victim is able to cancel them.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6278" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6279">Even if it were possible for Bitcoin's network to support billions of transactions per day, obviating the need for second‐layer processing, many, if not most, Bitcoiners with significant holdings will eventually resort to keeping them in one of the growing number of services for safe custody of Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6280">This is an entirely new industry and it is likely to evolve significantly to provide technical solutions for storage with different degrees of safety and liquidity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6281">Whatever shape this industry takes, the services it provides and how it evolves will shape the contours of a Bitcoin‐based banking system in the future. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6282">I make no prediction as to what shape these services will take, and what technological capabilities they will have, except to say that it will likely utilize cryptographic proof mechanisms on top of establishing market reputation in order to operate successfully. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6283">One possible technology for how this might be achieved is known as the Lightning Network, a technology under development that promises increasing transaction capacity significantly by allowing nodes to run payment channels off‐chain, which only use the Bitcoin ledger for verification of valid balances rather than transfers.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6284" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6285">In 2016 and 2017, as Bitcoin approached the maximum number of daily transactions, the network continued to grow, as is clear from the data in </span><a href="#calibre_link-112" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6286">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6287">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6288">Bitcoin is scaling</span><span type="pagebreak" title="238" id="calibre_link-210" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6289"> through an increase in the value of on‐chain transactions, not through a rise of their number. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6290">More and more transactions are being carried out off‐chain, settled on exchanges or websites that handle Bitcoin, turning Bitcoin into more of a settlement network than a direct payment network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6291">This does not represent a move away from Bitcoin's function as cash, as is commonly believed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6292">While the term </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6293">cash</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6294"> has come to denote the money used for small consumer transactions today, the original meaning of the term refers to money that is a bearer instrument, whose value can be transferred directly without resort to settlement by, or liability of, third parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6295">In the nineteenth century, the term </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6296">cash</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6297"> referred to central bank gold reserves, and cash settlement was the transfer of physical gold between banks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6298">If this analysis is correct, and Bitcoin continues to grow in value and off‐chain transactions while on‐chain transactions do not grow as much, Bitcoin would be better understood as cash in the old meaning of the term, similar to gold cash reserves, rather than the modern term for cash as paper money for small transactions.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6299" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6300">In conclusion, there are many possibilities for increasing the number of bitcoin transactions without having to alter the architecture of Bitcoin as it is, and without requiring all current node operators to upgrade simultaneously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6301">Scaling solutions will come from node operators improving the way they send data on Bitcoin transactions to other network members. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6302">This will come through joining transactions together, off‐chain transactions, and payment channels. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6303">On‐chain scaling solutions are unlikely to be enough to meet the growing demand for Bitcoin over time, and so second‐layer solutions are likely to continue to grow in importance, leading to the emergence of a new kind of financial institution similar to today's banks, using cryptography, and operating primarily online.</span></p></section>

<h2 id="calibre_link-561" class="calibre7"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6305">Is Bitcoin for Criminals?</span></h2>
<p id="calibre_link-6306" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6307">One of the very common misconceptions about Bitcoin from its inception is that it would make a great currency for criminals and terrorists. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6308">A long list of press articles have been published with unsubstantiated claims that terrorists or criminal gangs are using Bitcoin for their activity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6309">Many of these articles have</span><span type="pagebreak" title="239" id="calibre_link-645" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6310"> been retracted,</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-391" href="#calibre_link-375" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6311">7</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6312"> but not before they have imprinted the idea into the minds of many people, including misguided criminals.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6313" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6314">The reality is that Bitcoin's ledger is globally accessible and immutable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6315">It will carry the record of every transaction for as long as Bitcoin is still operational. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6316">It is inaccurate to really say Bitcoin is anonymous, as it is rather pseudonymous. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6317">It is possible, though not guaranteed, to establish links between real‐life identities and Bitcoin addresses, thus allowing the full tracking of all transactions by an address once its identity is established. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6318">When it comes to anonymity, it is useful to think of Bitcoin as being as anonymous as the Internet: it depends on how well you hide, and how well the others look. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6319">Yet Bitcoin's blockchain makes hiding that much more difficult on the Web. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6320">It is easy to dispose of a device, email address, or IP address and never use it again, but it is harder to completely erase the trail of funds to one bitcoin address. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6321">By its very nature, Bitcoin's blockchain structure is not ideal for privacy.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6322" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6323">All of this means that for any crime that actually has a victim, it would be inadvisable for the criminal to use Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6324">Its pseudonymous nature means that addresses could be linked to real‐world identities, even many years after the crime is committed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6325">The police, or the victims and any investigators they hire, might well be able to find a link to the identity of the criminal, even after many years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6326">The Bitcoin trail of payments itself has been the reason that many online drug dealers have been identified and caught as they fell for the hype of Bitcoin as completely anonymous.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6327" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6328">Bitcoin is a technology for money, and money is something that can be used by criminals at all times. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6329">Any form of money can be used by criminals or to facilitate crime, but Bitcoin's permanent ledger makes it particularly unsuited to crimes with victims likely to try to investigate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6330">Bitcoin can be useful in facilitating “victimless crimes,” where the absence of the victim will mean nobody trying to establish the identity of the “criminal.” </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6331">In reality, and once one overcomes the propaganda of the twentieth‐century state, there is no such thing as a victimless crime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6332">If an action has no victims, it is no crime, regardless of what some self‐important voters or bureaucrats would like to believe about their prerogative to legislate morality</span><span type="pagebreak" title="240" id="calibre_link-224" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6333"> for others. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6334">For these illegal but perfectly moral actions, Bitcoin could be useful because there are no victims to try to hunt down the perpetrator. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6335">The harmless activity carried out shows up on the blockchain as an individual transaction which could have a multitude of causes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6336">So one can expect that victimless crimes, such as online gambling and evading capital controls, would use Bitcoin, but murder and terrorism would more likely not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6337">Drug dealing seems to happen on the Bitcoin blockchain, though that is likely more down to addicts' cravings than sound judgment, as evidenced by the large number of Bitcoin drug purchasers that have been identified by law enforcement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6338">While statistics on this matter are very hard to find, I would not be surprised to find buying drugs with Bitcoin is far more dangerous than with physical government money.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6339" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6340">In other words, Bitcoin will likely increase individuals' freedom while not necessarily making it easier for them to commit crimes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6341">It is not a tool to be feared, but one to be embraced as an integral part of a peaceful and prosperous future.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6342" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6343">One high‐profile type of crime that has indeed utilized Bitcoin heavily is ransomware: a method of unauthorized access to computers that encrypts the victims' files and only releases them if the victim makes a payment to the recipient, usually in Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6344">While such forms of crime were around before Bitcoin, they have become more convenient to carry out since Bitcoin's invention. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6345">This is arguably the best example of Bitcoin facilitating crime. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6346">Yet one can simply understand that these ransomware crimes are being built around taking advantage of lax computer security. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6347">A company that can have its entire computer system locked up by anonymous hackers demanding a few thousand dollars in Bitcoin has far bigger problems than these hackers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6348">The incentive for the hackers may be in the thousands of dollars, but the incentive for the firm's competitors, clients, and suppliers for gaining access to this data can be much higher. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6349">In effect, what Bitcoin ransomware has allowed is the detection and exposition of computer security flaws. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6350">This process is leading firms to take better security precautions, and causing computer security to grow as an industry. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6351">In other words, Bitcoin allows for the monetizing of the computer security market. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6352">While hackers can initially benefit from this, in the long run, productive businesses will command the best security resources.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-6355" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6356">Many Bitcoiners have developed quasi‐religious</span><span type="pagebreak" title="241" id="calibre_link-646" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6357"> beliefs in the ability of Bitcoin to survive come what may. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6358">The amount of processing power behind it and the large number of nodes distributed worldwide verifying transactions means that it is highly resistant to change and likely to remain as such. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6359">Most of those unfamiliar with Bitcoin will frequently believe that it is doomed because it will inevitably get hacked, like everything digital seems to. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6360">Once Bitcoin's operation is understood, it becomes clear that “hacking” it is not a straightforward task. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6361">There are several other possible threats to Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6362">Computer security is a fundamentally intractable problem, as it involves unpredictable attackers finding new angles of attack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6363">It is beyond the scope of this book to elucidate all potential threats to Bitcoin and assess them.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-392" href="#calibre_link-376" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6364">8</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6365"> This section examines only some of the more high‐profile threats and the ones most relevant to the focus of this book on Bitcoin as sound money.</span></p>
<section class="calibre2"><span id="calibre_link-6366" class="calibre"></span>
<h3 class="calibre30"><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6367">Hacking</span></i></h3>
<p id="calibre_link-6368" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6369">Bitcoin's resistance to attack is rooted in three properties: its barebones simplicity, the vast processing power that does nothing but ensure the safety of this very simple design, and the distributed nodes which need to achieve consensus on any change for it to take effect. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6370">Imagine the digital equivalent of placing the entirety of the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6371">military's infantry and equipment around a school playground to protect it from invasion and you begin to get an idea of how overly fortified Bitcoin is.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6372" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6373">Bitcoin is at its essence a ledger of ownership of virtual coins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6374">There are only 21 million of these coins, and a few million addresses that own them, and every day no more than 500,000 transactions move some of these coins around. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6375">The computing power necessary to operate such a system is minuscule. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6376">A laptop for $100 could do it while also surfing the Web. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6377">But the reason Bitcoin is not run on one laptop is that such an arrangement would require trust in the owner of the laptop while also being a relatively simple target for hacking.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6378" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6379">All computer networks rely for their security</span><span type="pagebreak" title="242" id="calibre_link-166" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6380"> on making some computers impenetrable to attackers and using these as the definitive record. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6381">Bitcoin, on the other hand, takes an entirely different approach to computer security: it does not bother to secure any of its computers individually, and operates under the working assumption that all computer nodes are hostile attackers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6382">Instead of establishing trust in any network member, Bitcoin verifies everything they do. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6383">That process of verification, through proof‐of‐work, is what consumes large amounts of processing power, and it has proven very effective because it makes Bitcoin security dependent on brute processing power, and as such, invulnerable to problems of access or credentials. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6384">If everyone is assumed dishonest, everyone must pay a large cost to commit transactions to the common record, and everyone will lose these costs if their fraud is detected. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6385">The economic incentives make dishonesty extremely expensive and highly unlikely to succeed.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6386" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6387">To hack Bitcoin, in the sense of corrupting the ledger of transactions to fraudulently move coins to a specific account, or to make it unusable, would require a node to post an invalid block to the blockchain, and the network to adopt it and continue to build on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6388">Because nodes have a very low cost of detecting fraud, while the cost of adding a block of transactions is high and continuously rising, and because the majority of nodes in the network have an interest in Bitcoin surviving, this battle is unlikely to be won by attackers, and continues to get harder as the cost of adding blocks gets higher.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6389" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6390">At the heart of Bitcoin's design there is a fundamental asymmetry between the cost of committing a new block of transactions and the cost of verifying the validity of these transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6391">This means while forging the record is technically possible, the economic incentives are highly stacked against it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6392">The ledger of transactions as a result constitutes an undisputable record of valid transactions so far.</span></p></section>

<h3 class="calibre30"><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6394">The 51% Attack</span></i></h3>
<p id="calibre_link-6395" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6396">The 51% attack is a method of using large amounts of hashrate to generate fraudulent transactions, by spending the same coin twice, thus having one of the transactions canceled and defrauding the recipient. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6397">In essence, if a miner who controls a large percentage of the hashrate manages to solve proof‐of‐work problems quickly, he could</span><span type="pagebreak" title="243" id="calibre_link-647" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6398"> spend a bitcoin on a public chain that receives confirmations while mining another fork of the blockchain with another transaction of the same bitcoin to another address, belonging to the attacker. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6399">The recipient of the first transaction receives confirmations, but the attacker will attempt to use his processing power to make the second chain longer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6400">If he succeeds in making the second chain longer than the first one, the attack succeeds, and the recipient of the first transaction will find the coins they received vanish.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6401" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6402">The more hashrate the attacker is able to command, the more likely he is to make the fraudulent chain longer than the public one, and then reverse his transaction and profit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6403">While this may sound simple in principle, in practice it has been much harder. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6404">The longer the recipient waits for confirmation, the less likely it is that the attacker can succeed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6405">If the recipient is willing to wait for six confirmations, the probability of an attack succeeding shrinks infinitely low.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6406" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6407">In theory, the 51% percent attack is very feasible technically. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6408">But in practice, the economic incentives are heavily aligned against it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6409">A miner who successfully executes a 51% attack would severely undermine the economic incentives for anyone to use Bitcoin, and with that the demand for Bitcoin tokens. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6410">As Bitcoin mining has grown to become a heavily capital‐intensive industry with large investments dedicated to producing coins, miners have grown to have a vested long‐term interest in the integrity of the network, as the value of their rewards depends on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6411">There have been no successful double‐spend attacks on any Bitcoin transactions that have been confirmed at least once.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6412" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6413">The closest thing to a successful double‐spend attack that Bitcoin has witnessed was in 2013, when a Bitcoin betting site called Betcoin Dice had a sum in the range of 1,000 bitcoins (valued at around $100,000 at the time) stolen from it through double‐spend attacks utilizing significant mining resources. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6414">That attack, however, only succeeded because Betcoin Dice was accepting transactions with zero confirmations, making the cost of attack relatively low. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6415">Had they accepted transactions with one confirmation, it would have been much harder to pull off the attack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6416">This is another reason Bitcoin's blockchain is not ideal for mass consumer payments: it takes somewhere in the range of 1 to 12 minutes for a new block to be generated to produce one confirmation for a transaction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6417">Should a large payment processor want to accept taking the risk of approving payments with zero confirmations, it</span><span type="pagebreak" title="244" id="calibre_link-648" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6418"> constitutes a lucrative target for coordinated double‐spend attacks that utilize heavy mining resources.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6419" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6420">In conclusion, a 51% attack is theoretically possible to execute if the recipients of the payment are not waiting for a few blocks to confirm the validity of the transaction. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6421">In practice, however, the economic incentives are heavily against owners of hashpower utilizing their investments in this avenue, and as a result, there have been no successful 51% attacks on node members that have waited for at least one confirmation.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6422" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6423">A 51% attack would likely not be successful if done for a profit motive, but such an attack could also be carried out with no profit motive, but with the intention of destroying Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6424">A government or private entity could decide to acquire Bitcoin mining capacity to commandeer a majority of the Bitcoin network and then proceed to use that hashrate to launch continuous double‐spend attacks, defrauding many users and destroying confidence in the safety of the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6425">Yet the economic nature of mining is heavily stacked against this scenario materializing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6426">Processing power is a highly competitive global market, and Bitcoin mining is one of the largest, most profitable, and fastest growing uses of processing power in the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6427">An attacker may look at the cost of commandeering 51% of current hashing power and be willing to dedicate that cost to purchasing the hardware necessary for this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6428">But if such an enormous amount of resources were mobilized to buy Bitcoin mining equipment, it would simply lead to a sharp rise in the price of this equipment, which would reward current miners and allow them to invest more heavily in buying more mining equipment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6429">It would also lead to heavier capital investment in the production of mining power by mining producers, which would bring the cost of processing power down and allow the faster growth of Bitcoin's hashrate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6430">As an outsider entering the market, the attacker is at a constant disadvantage as his own purchasing of mining equipment leads to the faster growth of the mining processing power not controlled by him. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6431">In turn, the more resources are expended on building processing power to attack Bitcoin, the faster the growth of the processing power of Bitcoin and the harder it becomes to attack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6432">So, yet again, while technically possible, the economics of the network makes it highly unlikely that such an attack would succeed.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6433" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6434">An attacker, particularly a state, could attempt</span><span type="pagebreak" title="245" id="calibre_link-167" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6435"> to attack Bitcoin through taking control of existing mining infrastructure and using it unprofitably in order to undermine the safety of the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6436">The fact that Bitcoin mining is widely distributed geographically makes this a challenging prospect that would require collaboration from various governments worldwide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6437">A better way to implement this might be not through physically taking over mining equipment but commandeering it through hardware backdoors.</span></p></section>

<h3 class="calibre30"><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6439">Hardware Backdoors</span></i></h3>
<p id="calibre_link-6440" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6441">Another possibility for disrupting or destroying the Bitcoin network is through corrupting hardware that runs bitcoin software to be accessible by outside parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6442">Nodes that perform mining could, for example, be fitted with undetectable malware that allows outsiders to commandeer the hardware. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6443">This equipment could then be deactivated or remotely controlled at a time when a 51% attack is launched.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6444" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6445">Another example would be through spying technology installed on user computers allowing access to users' bitcoins by accessing their private keys. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6446">Such attacks on a mass scale could severely undermine confidence in Bitcoin as an asset and demand for it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6447" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6448">Both types of attack are feasible technically, and unlike the previous two kinds of attacks, they do not have to succeed entirely in order to create enough confusion to hurt Bitcoin's reputation and demand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6449">Such an attack on mining equipment is more likely to succeed given that there are only a few manufacturers of mining equipment, and this constitutes one of Bitcoin's most critical points of failure. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6450">However, as Bitcoin mining is growing, it is likely to start attracting more hardware makers to manufacture its equipment, which would reduce the disastrous impact on the network from the compromise of one manufacturer's operations.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6451" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6452">With individual computers, this risk is less systematic to the network because there is a virtually limitless number of manufacturers worldwide that access equipment capable of accessing the Bitcoin network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6453">Should any one producer turn out to be compromised, it is just likely to lead to consumers shifting to other producers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6454">Further, users can generate the private keys to their addresses on offline computers which they will never connect to the Internet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6455">The extra‐paranoid can even generate their addresses and private keys on offline computers</span><span type="pagebreak" title="246" id="calibre_link-225" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6456"> which are then immediately destroyed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6457">Coins stored on these virtual private keys will survive any kind of attack on the network.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6458" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6459">Particularly important defenses against these kinds of attacks are Bitcoiners' anarchist and cypherpunk tendencies, which lead them to believe much more in verification than trust. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6460">Bitcoiners are generally far more technically competent than the average population, and they are very meticulous about examining the hardware and software they utilize. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6461">The open source peer review culture also acts as a significant defense against these sorts of attacks. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6462">Given the distributed nature of the network, it is far more likely that such attacks could cause significant costs and losses to individuals, and perhaps even systemic disruptions of the network, but it will be very hard to cause the network to come to a standstill or to destroy demand for Bitcoin completely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6463">The reality is that the economic incentives of Bitcoin are what make it valuable, not any type of hardware. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6464">Any individual piece of equipment is dispensable to the operation of Bitcoin and can be replaced with other equipment. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6465">Nonetheless, Bitcoin's survival and robustness will be enhanced if it can diversify its hardware providers to not make any of them systemically important.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-6468" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6469">One of the most commonly held misconceptions about Bitcoin is that it can be shut down by shutting down important communications infrastructure on which Bitcoin relies, or shutting down the Internet. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6470">The problem with these scenarios is that they misunderstand Bitcoin as if it is a network in the traditional sense of dedicated hardware and infrastructure with critical points that can be attacked and compromised. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6471">But Bitcoin is a software protocol; it is an internal process that can be carried out on any one of billions of computer machines that are distributed worldwide. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6472">Bitcoin has no single point of failure, no single indispensable hardware structure anywhere in the world on which it relies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6473">Any computer that runs Bitcoin's software can connect to the network and carry out operations on it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6474">It is in that sense similar to the Internet, in that it is a protocol that allows computers to connect together; it is not the infrastructure which connects them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6475">The quantity of data that is required to pass on information about Bitcoin is not very large,</span><span type="pagebreak" title="247" id="calibre_link-649" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6476"> and a tiny fraction of the total amount of Internet traffic. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6477">Bitcoin does not need as extensive an infrastructure as the rest of the Internet, because its blockchain is really only about transmitting 1 megabyte of data every ten minutes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6478">There are countless wired and wireless technologies for the transmission of data worldwide, and any particular user only needs one of these to be working to connect to the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6479">In order to create a world in which no Bitcoin user is able to connect to other users, the kind of damage that would be needed to be done to the world's information, data, and connectivity infrastructure would be absolutely devastating. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6480">The life of modern society depends to a very large degree on connectivity, and many vital services and matters of life and death rely on these communication infrastructures continuing. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6481">To begin trying to turn off all of the Internet infrastructure simultaneously would likely cause significant damage to any society that tries it while likely failing to stem the flow of Bitcoin, as dispersed machines can always connect to one another using protocols and encrypted communications. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6482">There are simply far too many computers and connections spread out all over the world, utilized by far too many people, for any force to be able to make them all stop functioning simultaneously. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6483">The only conceivable scenario where this could happen would be through the sort of apocalyptic scenario after which there would be nobody left to even wonder if Bitcoin is operational or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6484">Of all the threats that are often mentioned against Bitcoin, I find this to be the least credible or meaningful.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-6487" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6488">Rather than imagining futuristic sci‐fi scenarios involving the destruction of humanity's telecommunication infrastructure in a futile attempt at eradicating a software program, there are far more realistic threats to Bitcoin grounded in the fundamentals of its design. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6489">Bitcoin's property as hard money whose supply cannot be tampered with, and as uncensorable digital cash without the possibility for third‐party intervention, is dependent upon the consensus rules of the network remaining very hard to change, especially the money supply. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6490">What achieves this stable status quo, as discussed earlier, is that it is a highly risky and likely negative move for a network member to move out of the current consensus rules if the other members of the</span><span type="pagebreak" title="248" id="calibre_link-281" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6491"> network do not also move to the new consensus rules. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6492">But what keeps that move highly risky and unlikely is that the number of nodes running the software is large enough that coordination between them is not practical. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6493">Should the cost of running a Bitcoin node increase significantly, it would make running a node harder for more and more users, and as a result it would decrease the number of nodes on the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6494">A network with a few dozen nodes stops being an effectively decentralized network as it becomes very possible for the few nodes that operate it to collude to alter the rules of the network to their own benefit, or even to sabotage it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6495" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6496">This remains in my opinion the most serious technical threat to Bitcoin in the medium and long term. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6497">As it stands, the main constraint on individuals being able to run their own nodes is the Internet connection bandwidth. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6498">As blocks remain under 1 megabyte, this should be generally manageable. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6499">A hard fork that increases the size of the block would cause a rise in the cost of running a node and lead to a reduction in the number of operational nodes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6500">And just like with the previous threats, while this is certainly technically possible, it remains unlikely to materialize because the economic incentives of the system militate against it, as evidenced by the widespread rejection of attempts to increase the blocksize so far.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-6503" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6504">The SHA‐256 hashing function is an integral part of the operation of the Bitcoin system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6505">Briefly, hashing is a process that takes any stream of data as an input and transforms it into a dataset of fixed size (known as a hash) using a nonreversible mathematical formula. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6506">In other words, it is trivial to use this function to generate a hash for any piece of data, but it is not possible to determine the original string of data from the hash. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6507">With improvements in processing power, it might become possible for computers to reverse‐calculate these hashing functions, which would render all Bitcoin addresses vulnerable to theft.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6508" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6509">It is not possible to ascertain if and when such a scenario might unfold, but if it does, it would constitute a very serious technical threat to Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6510">The technical fix to counter this is to switch to a stronger form of encryption, but the tricky part is to coordinate a hard fork that brings most of the nodes of the network</span><span type="pagebreak" title="249" id="calibre_link-349" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6511"> to abandon the old consensus rules for a new set of rules with a new hashing function. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6512">All of the problems previously discussed in the difficulty of coordinating a fork apply here, but this time, because the threat is real, and any Bitcoin holder who chooses to stay on the old implementation will be vulnerable to hacking, it is likely that an overwhelming majority of users will take part in a hard fork. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6513">The only interesting question that remains is whether this hard fork will be orderly and witness all users migrate to the same chain, or if it will lead to the chain splitting into several branches using different encryption methods. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6514">While it is certainly possible that the SHA‐256 encryption may be broken, the economic incentives of network users are to switch from it to a stronger algorithm, and to switch together to one algorithm.</span></p></section>

<h3 class="calibre30"><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6516">A Return to Sound Money</span></i></h3>
<p id="calibre_link-6517" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6518">While most discussions of how Bitcoin could fail or get destroyed focus on technical attacks, a far more promising way of attacking Bitcoin is through undermining the economic incentives to its use. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6519">To attempt to attack or destroy Bitcoin in any of the ways mentioned earlier is highly unlikely to succeed because it conflicts with the economic incentives that drive the use of Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6520">The situation is analogous to trying to ban the wheel or a knife. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6521">As long as the technology is useful for people, attempts at banning it will fail as people will continue to find ways of utilizing it, legally or not. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6522">The only way that a technology can be stopped is not by banning it, but by inventing a better replacement or by obviating the need for its use. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6523">The typewriter could never be banned or legislated out of existence, but the rise of the PC did effectively kill it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6524" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6525">The demand for Bitcoin stems from the need of individuals all over the world to carry out transactions that bypass political controls and to have an inflation‐resistant store of value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6526">For as long as political authorities impose restrictions and limitations on individuals transferring money, and for as long as government money is easy money whose supply can be easily expanded according to the whims of politicians, demand for Bitcoin will continue to exist, and its diminishing supply growth is likely to lead to its value appreciating over time, thus attracting ever‐larger numbers of people to use it as a store of value.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6527" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6528">Hypothetically, if the entire</span><span type="pagebreak" title="250" id="calibre_link-272" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6529"> world's banking and monetary systems were replaced with those of the gold standard in the late nineteenth century, where individual freedom and hard money were paramount, the demand for Bitcoin would likely subside significantly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6530">It might just be the case that such a move would cause a large enough reduction in demand for Bitcoin that brings its price significantly down, hurting current holders significantly, increasing the volatility of the currency, and setting it back many years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6531">With the increased volatility and the availability of a reliable and relatively stable hard‐money international monetary standard, the incentive for using Bitcoin drops significantly. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6532">In a world in which governments' restrictions and inflationary tendencies are disciplined by the gold standard, it might just be the case that gold's first‐mover advantage and relative purchasing power stability would constitute an insurmountable hurdle for Bitcoin to overcome, by depriving Bitcoin of the fast growth in users and thus preventing it from reaching a large enough size with any semblance of stability in price.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6533" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6534">In practice, however, the possibility of a global return to sound money and liberal government is extremely unlikely as these concepts are largely alien to the vast majority of politicians and voters worldwide, who have been reared for generations to understand government control of money and morality as necessary for the functioning of any society. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6535">Further, even if such a political and monetary transformation were possible, Bitcoin's diminishing supply growth rate is likely to continue to make it an attractive speculative bet for many, which would in itself cause it to grow further and acquire a larger monetary role. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6536">In my assessment, a global monetary return to gold might be the most significant threat to Bitcoin, yet it is both unlikely to happen and unlikely to destroy Bitcoin completely.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6537" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6538">Another possibility for derailing Bitcoin would be through the invention of a new form of sound money that is superior to Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6539">Many seem to think that the other cryptocurrencies that mimic Bitcoin could achieve this, but it is my firm belief that none of the coins that copy Bitcoin's design can compete with Bitcoin on being sound money, for reasons discussed at length in the next section of the chapter, primarily: Bitcoin is the only truly decentralized digital currency which has grown spontaneously as a finely balanced equilibrium between miners, coders, and users, none of whom can control it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6540">It was only ever possible to develop one</span><span type="pagebreak" title="251" id="calibre_link-169" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6541"> currency based on this design, because once it became obvious that it is workable, any attempt at copying it will have been a top‐down and centrally controlled network which will never escape the control of its creators.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6542" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6543">So when it comes to Bitcoin's structure and technology, it is highly unlikely that any coin that copies it could replace Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6544">A new design and technology for implementing digital cash and hard money might produce such a competitor, although it is not possible to predict the emergence of such a technology before it is created, and a familiarity with the problem of digital cash over the years will make it clear that this is not an invention that would be easy to devise.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-6547" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6548">While Bitcoin was the first example of a peer‐to‐peer electronic cash, it was certainly not the last. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6549">Once Nakamoto's design was out in the open, and the currency succeeded in gaining value and adopters, many copied it to produce similar currencies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6550">Namecoin was the first such currency, which used Bitcoin's code and started operation in April 2011. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6551">At least 732 digital currencies were created by February 2017, according to </span><a href="http://coinmarketcap.com" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6552">coinmarketcap.com</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6553">.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6554" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6555">While it is common to think that these currencies exist in competition with Bitcoin, and that one of them might overtake Bitcoin in the future, in reality they are not in competition with Bitcoin because they can never have the properties that make Bitcoin functional as digital cash and sound money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6556">In order for a digital system to function as digital cash, it has to be outside the control of any third party; its operation needs to conform to the will of its user according to the protocol, with no possibility for any third party to stop these payments. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6557">After years of watching altcoins get created, it seems impossible that any coin will recreate the adversarial standoff that exists between Bitcoin stakeholders and prevents any party from controlling payments in it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6558" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6559">Bitcoin was designed by a pseudonymous programmer whose real identity is still unknown. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6560">He posted the design to an obscure mailing list for computer programmers interested in cryptography, and after receiving feedback on it over a few months, he launched the network with the late programmer Hal Finney, who</span><span type="pagebreak" title="252" id="calibre_link-252" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6561"> passed away in August 2014. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6562">After a few days of transacting with Finney and experimenting with the software, more members began to join the network to transact and mine. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6563">Nakamoto disappeared in mid‐2010, citing “moving to new projects” and has most likely never been heard from since.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-393" href="#calibre_link-377" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6564">9</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6565"> In all likelihood, there are around 1 million bitcoins that are held in an account that is or was controlled by Nakamoto, but these coins have not moved once. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6566">Nakamoto did, however, take extreme caution to ensure that he will not be identified, and until this day there is no compelling evidence to identify who the real Nakamoto is. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6567">Had he wanted to be identified, he would already have come forward. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6568">Had he left any evidence that could lead to the tracing of his identity, it would have likely already been used to do so. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6569">All of his writings and communications have been pored over obsessively by investigators and journalists to no avail. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6570">It is high time for everyone involved in Bitcoin to stop concerning themselves with the question of the identity of Nakamoto, and accept that it does not matter to the operation of the technology, in the same way that the identity of the inventor of the wheel no longer matters.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6571" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6572">Because Nakamoto and Finney are no longer with us, Bitcoin has not had any central authority figure or leader who could dictate its direction or exercise influence over the course of its development. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6573">Even Gavin Andresen, who was in close contact with Nakamoto, and one of the most identifiable faces of Bitcoin, has failed repeatedly at exercising influence on the direction of Bitcoin's evolution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6574">An email is often quoted in the press, claiming to be the last email ever sent by Nakamoto, which says, “I've moved on to other things. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6575">It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone.”</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-394" href="#calibre_link-378" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6576">10</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6577"> Andresen has repeatedly tried to increase the size of Bitcoin's blocks, but all his proposals to do so</span><span type="pagebreak" title="253" id="calibre_link-650" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6578"> have failed to gain traction with the operators of the nodes.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6579" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6580">Bitcoin has continued to grow and thrive in all the metrics mentioned in </span><a href="#calibre_link-112" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6581">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6582">, while the authority of any individual or party over it has diminished to insignificance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6583">Bitcoin can be understood as a sovereign piece of code, because there is no authority outside of it that can control its behavior. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6584">Only Bitcoin's rules control Bitcoin, and the possibility of changing these rules in any substantive way has become extremely impractical as the status‐quo bias continues to shape the incentives of everyone involved in the project.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6585" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6586">It is the sovereignty of Bitcoin code, backed by proof‐of‐work, which makes it a genuinely effective solution to the double‐spending problem, and a successful digital cash. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6587">And it is this trustlessness which other digital currencies cannot replicate. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6588">Facing any digital currency built after Bitcoin is a deep existential crisis: because Bitcoin is already in existence, with more security, processing power and an established user base, anybody looking to use digital cash will naturally prefer it over smaller and less secure alternatives. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6589">Because the replication of the code to generate a new coin is almost costless, and the imitation coins proliferate, no single coin is likely to develop any sort of significant growth or momentum unless there is an active team dedicated to nurturing it, growing it, coding it, and securing it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6590">Being the first such invention, Bitcoin demonstrating its value as digital cash and hard money was enough to secure growing demand for it, allowing it to succeed when the only person behind it was an anonymous programmer who practically spent no money on promoting it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6591">Being fundamentally knock‐offs that are very easy to recreate, all altcoins do not have this luxury of real‐world demand, and must actively build and increase this demand.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6592" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6593">This is why virtually all altcoins have a team in charge; they began the project, marketed it, designed the marketing material, and plugged press releases into the press as if they were news items, while also having the advantage of mining a large number of coins early before anybody had heard of the coins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6594">These teams are publicly known individuals, and no matter how hard they might try, they cannot demonstrate credibly that they have no control over the direction of the currency, which undermines any claims other currencies might have to being a form of digital cash that cannot be edited or controlled by any third party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6595">In other words, after the Bitcoin genie got </span><span type="pagebreak" title="254" id="calibre_link-228" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6596">out of the bottle, anybody trying to build an alternative to Bitcoin will only succeed by investing heavily in the coin, making them effectively in control of it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6597">And as long as there is a party with sovereign power over a digital currency, then that currency cannot be understood as a form of digital cash, but rather, a form of intermediated payment&mdash;and a very inefficient one at that.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6598" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6599">This presents a dilemma facing designers of alternative currencies: without active management by a team of developers and marketers, no digital currency will attract any attention or capital in a sea of 1,000+ currencies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6600">But with active management, development, and marketing by a team, the currency cannot credibly demonstrate that it is not controlled by these individuals. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6601">With a group of developers in control of the majority of coins, processing power, and coding expertise, the currency is practically a centralized currency where the interests of the team dictate its development path. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6602">There is nothing wrong with a centralized digital currency, and we may well get such competitors in a free market without government restrictions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6603">But there is something deeply and fundamentally wrong about a centralized currency that adopts a highly cumbersome and inefficient design whose only advantage is the removal of a single point of failure.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6604" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6605">This problem is more pronounced for digital currencies that begin with an Initial Coin Offering, which creates a highly visible group of developers communicating publicly with investors, making the entire project effectively a centralized project. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6606">The trials and tribulations of Ethereum, the largest coin in terms of market value after Bitcoin, illustrate this point vividly.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-6675" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6676">The fixation with blockchain technology is a great example of “cargo cult science,” an idea popularized by physicist Richard Feynman. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6677">The story goes that the U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6678">military established airplane landing strips to aid in military operations on an island in the South Pacific Ocean during World War II. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6679">The airplanes would usually bring gifts to the local inhabitants of the island, who used to enjoy them immensely. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6680">After the war ended and the airplanes stopped landing on the strip, the locals tried their best to bring the airplanes and their cargo back. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6681">In their desperation, they would mimic the behavior of the long‐gone military airport ground controllers, thinking that if they put a man in a hut with an antenna and light a fire, as the military ground controllers used to do, then the airplanes would come back and bring them the gifts. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6682">Clearly such a strategy could not work, because the procedures of the ground controllers were not creating airplanes out of thin air; they were but one integral part of an elaborate technological process, beginning with the manufacturing of the airplanes and their</span><span type="pagebreak" title="259" id="calibre_link-653" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6683"> departure from their bases, which the South Pacific islanders could not comprehend.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6684" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6685">Like these islanders, the people touting blockchain technology as a process that could generate economic benefits on its own do not understand the larger process of which it is a part. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6686">Bitcoin's mechanism for establishing the authenticity and validity of the ledger is extremely complex and complicated, but it serves an explicit purpose: issuing a currency and moving value online without the need for a trusted third party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6687">“Blockchain technology,” to the extent that such a thing exists, is not an efficient or cheap or fast way of transacting online. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6688">It is actually immensely inefficient and slow compared to centralized solutions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6689">The </span><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6690">only</span></i><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6691"> advantage that it offers is eliminating the need to trust in third‐party intermediation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6692">The only possible uses of this technology are in avenues where removing third‐party intermediation is of such paramount value to end users that it justifies the increased cost and lost efficiency. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6693">And the only process for which it actually can succeed in eliminating third‐party intermediation is the process of moving the native token of the network itself, as the code of the blockchain has no integrated control over anything taking place outside it.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6694" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6695">A comparison will help give a sense of just how inefficient bitcoin is as a method for running transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6696">If we strip away the trappings of decentralization, proof‐of‐work verification, mining, and trustlessness, and run a centralized version of Bitcoin, it would essentially consist of an algorithm for generating coins, and a database for coin ownership that processes around 300,000 transactions per day. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6697">Such tasks are trivial, and any modern personal computer could perform them reliably. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6698">In fact, a regular off‐the‐shelf consumer laptop can be made to process around 14,000 transactions per second, or all of Bitcoin's current daily transaction volume in 20 seconds.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-396" href="#calibre_link-382" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6699">12</span></a></sup><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6700"> To process Bitcoin's entire yearly transaction volume, a personal laptop would need little more than two hours.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6701" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6702">The problem with running such a currency on a personal laptop, however, is that it requires trust in the owner of the laptop and in the laptop's security and safety from attack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6703">In</span><span type="pagebreak" title="260" id="calibre_link-654" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6704"> order to make such a trivial software system run without requiring trust in any single party to not defraud the record of transactions or alter the rate of currency issuance, the only design anyone has found is Bitcoin's decentralized peer‐to‐peer network with proof‐of‐work verification. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6705">This is not a trivial software problem, and it took decades of computer programmers attempting different designs before one was found that could demonstrably achieve this. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6706">Whereas a good consumer laptop today has a hashrate around 10 megahashes per second, the Bitcoin network collectively processes around 20 exahashes per second, or the equivalent of 2 trillion laptops. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6707">In other words, to remove the need for trust, the processing power to run a simple currency and database software needs to be increased roughly by a factor of 2 trillion. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6708">It is not the currency and its transactions that require so much processing power; making the entire system trustless does. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6709">For any other computing process to be run using blockchain technology, it would need to fulfill two criteria:</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6710" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6711">First, the gains from decentralization need to be compelling enough to justify the extra costs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6712">For any process which will still require some form of trust in a third party to implement any small part of it, the extra costs of decentralization cannot be justified. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6713">For implementing contracts dealing with real‐world businesses under legal jurisdictions, there will still be legal oversight relating to the real‐world implementation of these contracts that can override the network consensus, making the extra cost of decentralization pointless. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6714">The same applies for decentralizing databases of financial institutions that will remain as trusted third parties in their own operations with one another or with their clients.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6715" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6716">Second, the initial process itself needs to be simple enough to ensure the ability to run the distributed ledger on many nodes, without the blockchain becoming too heavy to be distributed. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6717">As the process continues to repeat over time, the size of the blockchain will grow and become more and more unmanageable for distributed nodes to hold a full copy of the blockchain, ensuring that only a few large computers can operate the blockchain and rendering decentralization obsolete. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6718">Note here the distinction between nodes that carry the ledger and dedicated miners who solve the proof‐of‐work, which is discussed in </span><a href="#calibre_link-112" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6719">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6720">: miners need to expend enormous processing power to commit transactions to the joint ledger, whereas nodes need very little power to keep a copy of the ledger with which to verify the accuracy</span><span type="pagebreak" title="261" id="calibre_link-655" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6721"> of miners' transactions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6722">This is why nodes can be run on personal computers, whereas individual miners have the processing power of hundreds of personal computers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6723">Should the operation of the ledger itself become too complex, nodes will need to be large servers instead of personal computers, destroying the possibility of decentralization.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6724" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6725">The Bitcoin blockchain has placed a 1‐megabyte limit on the size of each block, which has limited the pace at which the blockchain has grown. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6726">That limit allows simple computers to be able to maintain and run a node. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6727">Should the size of each block increase, or should the blockchain be used for more sophisticated processes such as those touted by blockchain enthusiasts, it would become too large to be run on individual computers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6728">Centralizing the network over a few large nodes owned and operated by large institutions only defeats the entire point of decentralization.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6729" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6730">Trustless digital cash has so far been the only successful implementation for blockchain technology precisely because it is a clean and simple technological process to operate, leading to its ledger growing relatively slowly over time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6731">This means that being a member of the Bitcoin network is possible for a residential computer and connection in most of the world. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6732">Predictable controlled inflation also requires little processing power, but is a process whose decentralization and trustlessness offers enormous value to end users, as explained in </span><a href="#calibre_link-112" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6733">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6734">. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6735">All other monetary media today are controlled by parties who can inflate the supply in order to profit from increased demand. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6736">This is true for fiat currencies and nonprecious metals, but also for gold, which is held in large quantities by central banks ready to sell it onto the market to prevent it from appreciating too quickly and thus displacing fiat currencies. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6737">For the first time since the abolition of the gold standard, Bitcoin has made sound money easily available to anyone in the world who wants it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6738">This highly unlikely combination of lightweight computing load and heavy economic significance is why it has made sense to grow the size of the Bitcoin network's processing power to the largest network in history. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6739">It has proven impossible over eight years to find one other use case that is valuable enough to justify being distributed over thousands of node members while also being lightweight enough to allow for that decentralization.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6740" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6741">The first implication of this analysis is</span><span type="pagebreak" title="262" id="calibre_link-656" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6742"> that any change to Bitcoin's protocol that increases the size of the blockchain is highly unlikely to pass, not just for the reasons of immutability mentioned before, but also because it would likely prevent most node operators from managing to run their own nodes, and because they are the ones who decide which software runs, it is safe to assume a significant intransigent minority of node operators will continue to run the current software, holding their current bitcoins, making any attempt to upgrade the Bitcoin software effectively just another worthless altcoin like the hundreds of others that already exist.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6743" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6744">The second implication is that all the “blockchain technology” applications being touted as revolutionizing banking or database technology are utterly doomed to fail in achieving anything more than fancy demos that will never transfer to the real world, because they will always be a highly inefficient way for the trusted third parties that operate them to conduct their business. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6745">It is outside the realm of possibility that a technology designed specifically to eliminate third‐party intermediation could end up serving any useful purpose to the intermediaries it was created to replace.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6746" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6747">There are many easier and less cumbersome ways of recording transactions, but this is the only method that eliminates the need for a trusted third party. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6748">A transaction is committed to the blockchain because many verifiers compete to verify it for profit. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6749">Yet not one of them is relied upon or trusted for the transaction to go through. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6750">Rather, fraud is immediately detected and reversed by other network members who have strong incentives to ensure the integrity of the network. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6751">In other words, Bitcoin is a system built entirely on cumbersome and expensive verification so it can eliminate the need for any trust or accountability between all parties: it is 100% verification and 0% trust.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6752" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6753">Contrary to a lot of the hype surrounding Bitcoin, eliminating the need for trust in third parties is not an unquestionably good thing to do in all avenues of business and life. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6754">Once one understands the mechanism of Bitcoin's operation, it is clear that there is a trade‐off involved in moving to a system that does not rely on any trusted third parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6755">The advantages lie in individual sovereignty over the protocol, censorship‐resistance, and immutability of the money supply growth and technical parameters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6756">The disadvantages lie in the need for much larger processing power expenditure to perform the same amount</span><span type="pagebreak" title="263" id="calibre_link-657" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6757"> of work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6758">There is no reason, outside of naïve futuristic hype, to believe that this is a trade‐off that is worthwhile for much. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6759">It may well be that the only place where this trade‐off is worthwhile is the managing of a global homogeneous supranational sound money, for two important reasons. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6760">First, the excessive costs of operating the system can be recouped from slowly capturing parts of the global currency market, which runs at around 80 trillion U.S. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6761">dollars in value. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6762">Second, the nature of sound money, as explained earlier, lies precisely in the fact that no human is able to control it, and hence, a predictable immutable algorithm is uniquely suited for this task. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6763">Having thought of this question for years, in no other avenue of business can I find a similar process that is at once so important as to be worth the extra costs for disintermediation, as well as being so transparently simple that removing all human discretion would be a massive advantage.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6764" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6765">An analogy with the automobile is instructive here. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6766">In 1885, when Karl Benz added an internal combustion engine to a carriage to produce the first autonomously powered vehicle, the express purpose of that move was to remove horses from carriages and free people from having to constantly deal with horse excrement. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6767">Benz was not trying to make horses faster. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6768">Burdening a horse with a heavy metal engine will not make it go faster; it will only slow it down while doing nothing to reduce the amount of excrement it produces. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6769">Similarly, as </span><a href="#calibre_link-112" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6770">Chapter 8</span></a><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6771"> explained, the colossal processing power needed to make the Bitcoin network operate eliminates the need for a trusted third party to process payments or determine the supply of money. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6772">If the third party remains, then all of that processing power is a pointless waste of electricity.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6773" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6774">Only time will tell whether this model for Bitcoin will continue to grow in popularity and adoption. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6775">It is possible that Bitcoin will grow to displace many financial intermediaries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6776">It is also possible that bitcoin will stagnate or even fail and disappear. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6777">What cannot happen is Bitcoin's blockchain benefiting the intermediation it was specifically designed to replace.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6778" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6779">For any trusted third party carrying out payments, trading, or recordkeeping, the blockchain is an extremely costly and inefficient technology to utilize. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6780">A non‐Bitcoin blockchain combines the worst of both worlds: the cumbersome structure of the blockchain with the cost and security risk of trusted third parties. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6781">It is no wonder that eight years after its invention, blockchain technology</span><span type="pagebreak" title="264" id="calibre_link-658" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6782"> has not yet managed to break through in a successful, ready‐for‐market commercial application other than the one for which it was specifically designed: Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6783" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6784">Instead, an abundance of hype, conferences, and high‐profile discussions in media, government, academia, industry, and the World Economic Forum on the potential of blockchain technology has emerged. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6785">Many millions of dollars have been invested in venture capital, research, and marketing by governments and institutions that are seduced by the hype, without any practical result.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6786" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6787">Blockchain consultants have built prototypes for stock trading, asset registry, voting, and payment clearance. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6788">But none of them have been commercially deployed because they are more expensive than simpler methods relying on established database and software stacks, as the government of Vermont recently concluded.</span><sup class="calibre18"><a id="calibre_link-397" href="#calibre_link-383" class="calibre6"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6789">13</span></a></sup></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6790" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6791">Meanwhile, banks don't have a great track record in applying earlier technological advances for their own use. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6792">While JPMorgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon was touting blockchain technology in Davos in January 2016, his bank's Open Financial Exchange interfaces&mdash;a technology from 1997 to provide aggregators a central database of customer information&mdash;had been down for two months.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6793" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6794">In contrast, the Bitcoin network was born from the blockchain design two months after Nakamoto presented the technology. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6795">To this day, it has been operating uninterrupted and growing to more than $150 billion worth of bitcoins. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6796">The blockchain was the solution to the electronic cash problem. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6797">Because it worked, it grew quickly while Nakamoto worked anonymously and only communicated curtly via email for about two years. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6798">It did not need investment, venture capital, conferences, or advertisement.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6799" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6800">As will become apparent from this exposition, the notion that a “blockchain technology” exists and can be deployed to solve any specific problems is highly dubious. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6801">It is far more accurate to understand the blockchain structure as an integral part of the operation of Bitcoin and its testnets and copycats. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6802">Nevertheless, the term blockchain technology is used for simplicity in elucidation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6803">The next section of this chapter examines the most commonly</span><span type="pagebreak" title="265" id="calibre_link-343" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6804"> touted use‐cases for blockchain technology, while the section after it identifies the main impediments to its application to these problems.</span></p>

<h3 class="calibre30"><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6806">Potential Applications of Blockchain Technology</span></i></h3>
<p id="calibre_link-6807" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6808">An overview of startups and research projects related to blockchain technology concludes that the potential applications of blockchains can be divided into three main fields:</span></p>
<section class="calibre2"><span id="calibre_link-6809" class="calibre"></span>
<h4 class="calibre32"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6810">Digital Payments</span></h4>
<p id="calibre_link-6811" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6812">Current commercial mechanisms for payment clearance rely on centralized ledgers to record all transactions and maintain account balances. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6813">In essence, the transaction is transmitted once from the transacting parties to the intermediary, checked for validity, and accordingly both accounts are adjusted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6814">In a blockchain, the transaction is transmitted to all network nodes, which involves many more transmissions and more processing power and time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6815">The transaction also becomes part of the blockchain, copied onto every member computer. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6816">This is slower and more expensive than centralized clearance, and helps explain why Visa and MasterCard clear 2,000 transactions per second while Bitcoin can at best clear four. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6817">Bitcoin has a blockchain not because it allows for faster and cheaper transactions, but because it removes the need to trust in third‐party intermediation: transactions are cleared because nodes compete to verify them, yet no node needs to be trusted. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6818">It is unworkable for third‐party intermediaries to imagine they could improve their performance by employing a technology that sacrifices efficiency and speed precisely to remove third‐party intermediaries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6819">For any currency controlled by a central party, it will always be more efficient to record transactions centrally. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6820">What can be clearly seen is that blockchain payment applications will have to be with the blockchain's own decentralized currency, and not with centrally controlled currencies.</span></p></section>
<section class="calibre2"><span id="calibre_link-6821" class="calibre"></span>
<h4 class="calibre32"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6822">Contracts</span></h4>
<p id="calibre_link-6823" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6824">Currently, contracts are drafted by lawyers, judged by courts, and enforced by the police. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6825">Smart contract cryptographic systems such as Ethereum encode contracts into a blockchain to make them self‐executing, with no possibility for</span><span type="pagebreak" title="266" id="calibre_link-229" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6826"> appeal or reversal and beyond the reach of courts and police. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6827">“Code is law” is a motto used by smart contract programmers. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6828">The problem with this concept is that the language lawyers use to draft contracts is understood by far more people than the code language used by smart contract drafters. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6829">There are probably only a few hundred people worldwide with the technical expertise to fully understand the implications of a smart contract, and even they could miss glaring software bugs. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6830">Even as more people become proficient in the programming languages necessary to operate these contracts, the few people who are most proficient at it will by definition continue to have an advantage over the rest. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6831">Code competence will always offer a strategic advantage to the most proficient over everyone else.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6832" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6833">This all became apparent with the first implementation of smart contracts on the Ethereum network, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6834">After more than $150 million was invested in this smart contract, an attacker was able to execute the code in a way that diverted around a third of all the DAO's assets to his own account. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6835">It would be arguably inaccurate to describe this attack as a theft, because all the depositors had accepted that their money would be controlled by the code and nothing else, and the attacker had done nothing but execute the code as it was accepted by the depositors. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6836">In the aftermath of the DAO hack, Ethereum developers created a new version of Ethereum where this inconvenient mistake never occurred. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6837">This re‐injection of subjective human management is at odds with the objective of making code into law, and questions the entire rationale of smart contracts.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6838" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6839">Ethereum is the second largest blockchain after Bitcoin in terms of its processing power, and while the Bitcoin blockchain cannot effectively be rolled back, that Ethereum can be rolled back means that all blockchains smaller than Bitcoin's are effectively centralized databases under the control of their operators. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6840">It turns out code is not really law, because the operators of these contracts can override what the contract executes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6841">Smart contracts have not replaced courts with code, but they have replaced courts with software developers with little experience, knowledge, or accountability in arbitrating. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6842">It remains to be seen whether courts and lawyers will remain uninvolved as the ramifications of such forks continue to be explored.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6843" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6844">The DAO was the first and so far</span><span type="pagebreak" title="267" id="calibre_link-230" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6845"> only sophisticated application of a smart contract on a blockchain, and the experience suggests wider implementation is still a long way off, if it ever were to occur. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6846">All other applications currently only exist in prototype. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6847">Perhaps in a hypothetical future where code literacy is far more common and code more predictable and reliable, such contracts might become more commonplace. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6848">But if operating such contracts only adds processing power requirements while still leaving them subject to editing, forking, and overruling by the blockchain's engineers, then the entire exercise serves no purpose but the generation of buzzwords and publicity. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6849">A far more likely future for smart contracts is that they will exist over secured centralized computers operated by trusted third parties with the ability to override them. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6850">This formalizes the reality of blockchain smart contracts as editable while reducing the processing power requirement and reducing the attack vectors possible to compromise this.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6851" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6852">For actual operational blockchains, demand will likely only be found for simple contracts whose code can be easily verified and understood. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6853">The only rationale for employing such contracts on a blockchain rather than a centralized computer system would be for the contracts to utilize the blockchain's native currency in some form, as all other contracts are better enforced and supervised without the extra burden of a blockchain distributed system. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6854">The only existing meaningful blockchain contract applications are for simple time‐programmed payments and multi‐signature wallets, all of which are performed with the currency of the blockchain itself, mostly on the Bitcoin network.</span></p></section>

<p id="calibre_link-6857" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6858">Blockchain is a reliable and tamper‐proof database and asset register, but only for the blockchain's native currency and only if the currency is valuable enough for the network to have strong enough processing power to resist attack. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6859">For any other asset, physical or digital, the blockchain is only as reliable as those responsible for establishing the link between the asset and what refers to it on the blockchain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6860">There are no efficiency or transparency gains from using a permissioned blockchain here, as the blockchain is only as reliable as the party that grants permission to write to it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6861">Introducing blockchain to that party's recordkeeping is only going to make it slower while adding no security or immutability, because there is no proof‐of‐work. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6862">Trust in third‐party</span><span type="pagebreak" title="268" id="calibre_link-659" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6863"> intermediaries must remain while the processing power and time required for running the database increases. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6864">A blockchain secured with a token could be used as a notary service, where contracts or documents are hashed onto a block of transactions, allowing any party to access the contract and be sure that the version displayed is the one that was hashed at the time. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6865">Such a service will provide a market for scarce block space, but is unworkable with any blockchain without a currency.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-6881" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6882">A distributed network where all nodes record all transactions will have its common transaction ledger grow exponentially faster than the number of network members. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6883">The storage and computational burden on members of a distributed network will be far larger than a centralized network of the same size. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6884">Blockchains will always face this barrier to effective scaling, and this explains why as Bitcoin developers search for solutions for scaling, they are moving away from the pure decentralized blockchain model toward having payments cleared on second layers, such as the Lightning Network, or off the blockchain with intermediaries. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6885">There is a clear trade‐off between scale and decentralization. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6886">Should a blockchain be made to accommodate larger volumes of transactions, the blocks need to be made larger, which would raise the cost</span><span type="pagebreak" title="269" id="calibre_link-660" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6887"> of joining the network and result in fewer nodes. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6888">The network will tend toward centralization as a result. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6889">The most cost‐effective way to have a large volume of transactions is centralization in one node.</span></p></section>

<h3 class="calibre30"><i class="calibre12"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6945">Blockchain Technology as a Mechanism for Producing Electronic Cash</span></i></h3>
<p id="calibre_link-6946" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6947">The only commercially successful application of blockchain technology so far is electronic cash, and in particular, Bitcoin. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6948">The most common potential applications touted for blockchain technology&mdash;payments, contracts, and asset registry&mdash;are only workable to the extent that they run using the decentralized currency of the blockchain. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6949">All blockchains without currencies have not moved</span><span type="pagebreak" title="272" id="calibre_link-192" class="calibre15"></span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6950"> from the prototype stage to commercial implementation because they cannot compete with current best practice in their markets. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6951">Bitcoin's design has been freely available online for nine years, and developers can copy and improve on it to introduce commercial products, but no such products have appeared.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6952" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6953">The market test shows that the redundancies of transaction recording and proof‐of‐work can only be justified for the purpose of producing electronic cash and a payment network without third‐party intermediation. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6954">Electronic cash ownership and transactions can be communicated in very small quantities of data. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6955">Other economic cases which need more data requirements, such as mass payments and contracts, become unworkably cumbersome in the blockchain model. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6956">For any applications which involve intermediaries, the blockchain will offer an uncompetitive solution. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6957">There cannot be wide adoption of blockchain technology in industries reliant on trust in intermediaries, because the mere presence of intermediaries makes all the costs associated with running a blockchain superfluous. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6958">Any application of blockchain technology will only make commercial sense if its operation is reliant on the use of electronic cash, and only if electronic cash's disintermediation provides economic benefits outweighing the use of regular currencies and payment channels.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-6959" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6960">Good engineering begins with a clear problem and attempts to find the optimal solution for it. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6961">An optimal solution not only solves the problem, but by definition does not contain within it any irrelevant or superfluous excess. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6962">Bitcoin's creator was motivated by creating a “peer‐to‐peer electronic cash”, and he built a design for that end. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6963">There is no reason, except for ignorance of its mechanics, to expect that it would be suited for other functions. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6964">After nine years and millions of users, it is safe to say his design has succeeded in producing digital cash, and, unsurprisingly, nothing else. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6965">This electronic cash can have commercial and digital applications, but it is not meaningful to discuss blockchain technology as a technological innovation in its own right with applications in various fields. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-6966">Blockchain is better understood as an integral cog in the machine that creates peer‐to‐peer electronic cash with predictable inflation.</span></p>

<p id="calibre_link-7051" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7052">The research and editing for this book benefited from the work of my very able research assistants, Rebecca Daher, Ghida Hajj Diab, Maghy Farah, Sadim Sbeity, and Racha Khayat, to whom I am very thankful. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7053">Professor George Hall graciously provided me data from his research paper, for which I am grateful.</span></p>
<p id="calibre_link-7054" class="calibre13"><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7055">Finally, neither this book nor Bitcoin would be possible without the tireless work of the volunteer developers who have dedicated their time for the development and maintenance of the protocol. </span><span class="kobospan" id="calibre_link-7056">I am grateful for their selflessness and dedication to this project.</span></p>
